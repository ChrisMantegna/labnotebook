    "text": "Progress Makes a PhD\n\nMy Graduate Work in the Robertsâ€™ Lab at the University of Washington\nStraddling the line between classic ecological methods and cutting- edge molecular techniques, I am building my marine science foundation as a Marine Molecular Ecologist studying nearshore ecosystems in Puget Sound and the greater Salish Sea. While my graduate work is dominantly focused on informing conservation strategies, it can also be readily applied to aquaculture and sustainable food systems. The stars of the show are marine invertebrates, mostly foundational species like mussels, but I also incorporate the exploration of the relationship dynamics between human and non-human kin. Ultimately, I want to understand how human-induced environmental changes influence nearshore communities at different scales; both at the organismal and ecosystem level."
