    "text": "Progress Makes a PhD\n\nMy Graduate Work in the Roberts’ Lab at the University of Washington\nStraddling the line between classic ecological methods and cutting- edge molecular techniques, I am building my marine science foundation as a Marine Molecular Ecologist studying nearshore ecosystems in Puget Sound and the greater Salish Sea. While my graduate work is dominantly focused on conservation ecology, it can also be readily applied to aquaculture and sustainable food systems. The stars of the show are marine invertebrates, mostly foundational species like mussels, but I also incorporate the exploration of the relationship dynamics between human and non-human kin. Ultimately, I want to understand how human-induced environmental changes influence nearshore communities at different scales from the organismal and ecosystem level."

    "text": "I had the great fortune of collaborating with the University of Minnesota (UMN) and the National Museums of Kenya (KMN) in July and August to conduct field work that supported expanding our limited academic knowledge of Mormyrids, a weakly electric fish with a population in Lake Victoria, Kenya. Under the guidance of PI Kassie Ford, UMN Professor and Bell Museum Curator, we worked in direct collaboration with the ichthyologists at KMN to procure samples of as many species of mormyrids as we could for addition to the KMN fish collection and further projects amongst our respective institutions. My role, as the only non-ichthyologist, was to collect water and sediment samples for eDNA analysis to build a snapshot of the trophic composition of Lake Victoria and it’s estuaries along with collecting stomach contents from multiple species at each site to support the mormyrid diet analysis assesment of MS student Kassi Price.\nWe spent over a month visiting sites around the lake between the Tanzanian and Ugandan border (as well as the rivers that fed into the lake) collecting samples and assessing basic water quality (temperature, pH, salinity, etc), habitat differences, and watching over our shoulders for crocodiles and hippos! Ultimately, we used a variety of techniques and employed the support of local fishermen to expand our limited knowledge and help us reach our sampling goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt every single location we were greeted by people who were interested in our work. Dominantly children, but plenty of adults that helped us gain knowledge about the area, where to find certain fishes, and the best places to avoid conflict with wildlife. It was an incredibly welcoming and enthusiastic environment to work in. Most hilarious was the constant shouts of ‘Mzungu’ when local folks saw us in our vehicle or in the rivers or lake. It loosely means ‘European person’, but as we soon found out it essentially means anyone who is not from Kenya. It was really fun to talk with everyone as they were as interested in us as we were in them - it made long field days that much more enjoyable.\nAs we wrapped up our work and headed back to Nairobi, we parted ways with our KNM collaborators and closed our trip with a 3 day safari in Masai Mara National Park. To say it is as magical as you expect and more is an understatement. I know everyone loves the big cats, but my favorites were the zebras and the wildebeests.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe saw so many animals I had only seen in books or in zoos! Truth be told, the fish were cool, but this was a bucket list, once in a lifetime opportunity that I cannot get over. I am excited to be contributing to the body of knowledge around Lake Victoria by providing a baseline community composition in the dry season; something that doesn’t exist for any season, but I am most proud of the relationships we’re building, the future collaborations to come, and another opportunity to visit Kenya."

I was writing the results and trying to make some sense of what wasn’t sitting right, and it turns out that if you aren’t using the correct df in your code, you get a p-value of 0.478 for every single metric you are looking at when trying to understand if there are differences by site…\nAlison and I met to talk about the paper and how we’re going to get the manuscript ready for the WIMS x ICB submission window time frame. I felt really good about it and I believe she’s cautiously optimistic that we’ll make it!\nI had a wonderful conversation with Chelsea Wood today - scheduled - to discuss how to start curating my science brand and where to focus my professional development so that I’m not trying to slam in all of the work in my final year when I’m trying to apply for positions.\nI ended the day working on pulling lit on the efficacy of conservation ecology work. This proved to be very difficult to find since the dominant result was either about engineering, the role of specific species, or commentary on how conservation practices should work. I made a log of search terms, platforms, results returned and added about 30 papers that get close to my topic, but this is still not working as I wanted.\n\nUltimately, this makes me question how we get the siloed work of individual organizations aligned with the ‘big data’ that is being collected, or how we gain access or clarity around the data and action of the organizations. Trying to clarify the efficacy of conservation efforts is challenging, especially when we all define efficacy a bit different."

I added the tasks to my Notion management setup, separated in quick tasks and anything that will take longer than 30 minutes so I could manage getting a few things done where I can rather than try to knock out big chunks at a time.\n\nMy primary work (deep work) focused on getting back to the biomarker work I set down before leaving for the summer. I reviewed my most recent analysis notes, the questions/ comments I made for myself, and then the analyses. I had a hard time evaluating what was most important to tackle first, so I spent some time listing out my decisions to get to the end analyses and what result mapped to what choice before I could really get my head back in the game. This helped me identify an error in my contaminant indices and note that I needed to re-link the curated literature review to the draft in the methods and discussion drafting."

That flagged my need to clarify my work in both my mind and in how I share it - part of my personal goals for the year.\nI spent the rest of my science admin time assessing and mapping my deliverables for the bypass package and working to identify where I will need help.\n\nMy biomarker work was in mapping my plots for the manuscript and trying to get some of those plots to look better.

Is it effective? How do we know?\n\nScoped to historical efficacy, collegiate preparation and inclusion, and new data techniques to bring together all the pertinent information to make decisions.\nLooking through the data and practitioners - not policy even though I will have to address \n\nWhat teaching methods will support the learning and research for the next group of conservationists?\nWhere are the new and the established conservationists aligned or mismatched with current conservation professionals?\n\nSocial expectation - changes in workload versus personal time, work ethic?, compensation, and societal acceptance or celebration of the work\nEducational expectation - what skills are new folks coming in with, is it mismatched to what is needed, how does the UG degree provide (or not) the skills to be successful, and is there commentary on how that has changed over time?\nUrgency - efficacy is the question of the hour as we are losing time to ‘reverse’ or ‘stop’ change. Can we stop it, should we stop it, and how does multiple knowledge systems’ incorporation into the application of the data (and how its gathered) alter or confirm the future of conservation?\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Assumptions\n\nAssessing the nearshore environment from ecosystem level to organismal impact is thorough but incomplete without considering how the human element impacts the ecosystem.\nConservation Ecology is the end focus - what can my work do to bring together/ or bridge the existing data, identify where data is incomplete, or support the folks who want data-driven actions/ solutions to conservation\nWe are not working with micro-plastics. Contamination work is the only axis of alteration we are assessing directly.\n\n\n\nThings to Consider\n\nWhere are the gaps in my approach?\nCan I launch an eDNA bio blitz where WDFW is outplanting the mussels if we find interesting correlations from the biomarker work and the DNA methylation work?\nWhat are the other axes of human impact in conservation ecology that I’m overlooking OR need to address?"

    "text": "This page compiles all daily posts for 2025-09.\n\n\n2025-09-24 — New AY, New Set Up\nIn true to me fashion, a new academic year means a new notebook setup that will hopefully make it a bit easier for me to update my work daily. Today’s science focus was on rebuilding, updating and launching my 2025-26 AY lab notebook. Related, I made a ‘sprint’ task list for quick tasks I can do to tighten up my GitHub setup, cleanup my repos, and identify any pinch points for making a daily update. My second focus was to setup weekly meetings with my PI and gather materials for my first meeting on 9.25.25.\n\n\n2025-09-25 — Put Your $$ Where Your Mouth Is\n\nToday’s work fell in the broad category of preparing for lab meeting and the subsequent 1v1 with Steven. My main takeaways are to set explicit goals that we will share and work on in biweekly lab meetings.\n\nMy goal for next lab working session is to have one of my three bypass chapters complete to the standard of the package and the other two fully outlined.\n\nMeeting with Steven post lab meeting we agreed that my AY goal, to become a candidate by the end of the year, is big but doable as long as I stay accountable to myself. Additionally, my deliverable from the meeting is to complete the SAFS milestones form and get it back to him by the end of the week.\n\n\n\n2025-09-26 — Biomarkers, Back Again\n\nMy work today started with a quick audit of my GH repos and what should be cleaned up as I move forward. I added the tasks to my Notion management setup, separated in quick tasks and anything that will take longer than 30 minutes so I could manage getting a few things done where I can rather than try to knock out big chunks at a time.\n\nMy primary work (deep work) focused on getting back to the biomarker work I set down before leaving for the summer. I reviewed my most recent analysis notes, the questions/ comments I made for myself, and then the analyses. I had a hard time evaluating what was most important to tackle first, so I spent some time listing out my decisions to get to the end analyses and what result mapped to what choice before I could really get my head back in the game. This helped me identify an error in my contaminant indices and note that I needed to re-link the curated literature review to the draft in the methods and discussion drafting.\n\n\n\n2025-09-27 — Day Off\nNo science work was done today.\n\n\n2025-09-28 — Biomarkers Literature Reconciliation\n\nAll of today’s focus was in tidying up my notes and citations for the biomarker manuscript draft. I have left notes or comments for myself that are a little cryptic, or worse, tags that aren’t as descriptive as I need. The goal was to ensure I have the right citations in the right places and identify anything that needs additional depth in citations (biomarker work is rich in practitioners) or needs a citation period. This took much longer than I anticipated, so I knocked off for the day after that.\n\n\n\n2025-09-29 — Bypass & Biomarkers\n\nMost of today’s work focused on my science task management.\n\nI completed the overdue milestones in the new SAFS tracker. As soon as my committee signs the Docusigm, I can submit that and get off the ‘bad kids list’.\nI sent out the scheduler for my first committee meeting of the quarter. That meeting will be between 10/7 - 10/17.\nI sent my ‘degree work’ explainer over to Manca. She is helping to connect me to her former colleagues at WWU, so I needed to write a paragraph about my work and ultimate dissertation topic for her to send - that took me a surprisingly long time to craft. That flagged my need to clarify my work in both my mind and in how I share it - part of my personal goals for the year.\nI spent the rest of my science admin time assessing and mapping my deliverables for the bypass package and working to identify where I will need help.\n\nMy biomarker work was in mapping my plots for the manuscript and trying to get some of those plots to look better. Even when plotting by site (74 of them) the plots are a bit crowded, so I was working on that.\n\n\n\n2025-09-30 — It’s Epigenetics, Baby\n\nTuesdays are typically days where minimal science will be done since my student assistance-ship is the dominant player, but for at least one hour every week this quarter I’ll get some science in there!\n\nSteven’s class focused on epigenetics is a literature review class where we learn foundational concepts in the discipline and then bring our own interesting literature to present while interacting with what implications this information could have on our own work.\nToday was the first class, so it was a familiarization, a chance to read a foundational paper, and work test run the GitHub workflow for the course."

He gave me advice on how to frame that and we wrapped up for the day.\nI spent some time this evening working on the framing of my bypass presentation for my October 9th committee meeting\nWrapped up the day with work on the biomarker analysis. The correlations seem to be far higher in number of significant results than when I previously worked on it, so I needed to investigate. Turns out I created a loop that was correlating the wrong variables. Fixed that."

    "text": "Attended lab meeting where we shared our bi-weekly goals, progress, knowledge nuggets, and upcoming goals. My responses are below. My goals are built off of my Autumn quarter goals/ plan to meet those goals.\nI worked on my bypass presentation for my committee meeting on Thursday.\n\n\nNotes from 10.06.2025 Lab Meeting\n\nGoals set on 9/25/25: Have one chapter of my PhD proposal drafted and the others outlined.\n\nProgress as of 10/06/25\nAfter dusting off the docs and taking an inventory of where each of the pieces stand, I have the 3 PhD chapters outlined and pivoted to working on my first MS chapter. I chose to shift away from the PhD proposal focus so that I could knock out the MS chapter since it is my required manuscript for the package and needs to be reviewed/ approved by both the committee and WDFW.\n\n\nMy knowledge nuggets all center around things I’m using to maximize my working time and reduce the number of ‘administrative’ tasks I need to do to get rolling on the real work.\n\n\n1st- the Graduate School Funding Guide has a huge database (GFIS) of funding opportunities that you can search, download into a csv and explore on your own time. It also has the college-wide Assistantships database you can explore. There are dedicated support resources through the library if you have questions.\n2nd- If you use Zotero and want to clean up your literature review process, link it to something like Notion or any other organizational platform that supports integration and keep all of your notes and annotations in one place. This video from The Grad School Coach shows you how to integrate Notion & Zotero, and this video from Aynur Science on how to create a literature review workflow using Notion that supports information recall.\n3rd- Wondering where your time is going? I did my own time trials using Toggl this summer to see how long my most frequent tasks (reading and annotating a paper, coding plots, setting up data cleaning scripts, etc.) take me to complete so that I could better schedule my day and not demoralize myself when I’m not meeting my productivity goals. I used daily to track my time, help me build my weekly time blocking schedules, and review where I’m getting lost, and as a bonus, I can see just how much work on each project I am putting in and how to adjust for the upcoming week. Toggl is platform that you can use for free, but there are paid upgrades if you want them. I’ve been using it since July and haven’t needed to upgrade at all, all of the free functions are great.\n\n\nGoals set on 10/06 for completion by 10/20 lab meeting:\n1. Finish the biomarker manuscript 10/9\n2. Finish the committee meeting presentation 10/9\n3. Complete draft of my MS thesis 10/14\n4. Create bench protocol for Kenya samples 10/20"

I reviewed my most recent analysis notes, the questions/ comments I made for myself, and then the analyses. I had a hard time evaluating what was most important to tackle first, so I spent some time listing out my decisions to get to the end analyses and what result mapped to what choice before I could really get my head back in the game.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Notion has been a management and organization tool that I have been using on and off for the last 6 years, and finally this year I have hit my stride with the platform. This week’s wrap-up is about how I use Notion to manage my day to day responsibilities and how to avoid some of the mistakes I’ve made along the way.\nMost important to remember about the platform is that it is a tool that is typically aligned with productivity and project management, but the thousands of users and the seemingly unlimited customization abilities of Notion can make it whatever you want from a whole life management tool to a simple task manager.\n\n\nSince most folks use it as a life or project management tool, the setups align with a few titans in the productivity space. I’ve listed a few of them and their books below.\n\nGetting Things Done (GTD) — David Allen\nBuilding a Second Brain — Tiago Forte\nAtomic Habits — James Clear\nDeep Work — Cal Newport\nThe Bullet Journal Method — Ryder Carroll\nThe 12-Week Year — Brian Moran & Michael Lennington\nYou may notice that the productivity space that guides a lot of this is male- dominated… do not be fooled the Notion girlies (and our non-binary builders) are what turns a simple system from a rigid practice to a flexible tool with a little pizzazz to keep you coming back to using it! More impactful, I found several of the concepts in the books to be less intuitive than I would like and the Notion girlies came through with great ways to help me think about adapting the systems to how my life works.\nGetting started on the platform is free and 99% of the platform’s functionality is available at the free tier. There are paid tiers and a free pro account if you are a student. I believe the limitation between a free versus paid account is in the storage space, but I haven’t encountered a problem. In addition, there are tons of free templates to get you rolling if you want some inspiration before building your own pages.\n\n\nThere are a few things to consider before you go down the rabbit hole, and those are having a clear vision of what you want to use Notion for, identifying what in your current system is and is not aligned, and finally, how can Notion support you in meeting your goals rather than create a distraction or friction point in your process. Let me explain what I mean.\n\nFirst, you have to decide is what you want to use Notion to do - is it replacing other management software, consolidating a multi-tool workflow that isn’t working, or do you want it to integrate into a system you are already using? I use it as the single place I operate my day-to-day from; multiple responsibilities for me means multiple ways I can lose myself in task switching and that tanks my productivity. I was looking for a way to help me integrate the parts of my workflow that were working and help me set up a place where I could manage the pieces that weren’t. For example, I love to use my Notes app to keep running to-do lists, drop thoughts or ideas, or make quick reminders to myself. The problem is that there’s no tracking, connection to the larger project the idea or task relates to, and no way to see if I’ve already dropped this brain bit into its project or calendar or whatever and that is frustrating. It felt like I was doing triple work just to get everything aligned and that led to task overwhelm and progress stunting.\nSecond, think about your working style. Notion can be as standardized or bespoke as you’d like it to be - everyone has some new way to get it done, and if you aren’t sure what you’re trying to do and how you work, you will surely create something that creates more work than it is worth. For example, I keep a working log of notes in my Google Drive for each project and I thought maybe I would transition it to the Notion projects I built - it was more hassle than it was worth since it upended the habit I built by not matching the functionality or flexibility I need for that task. To combat making that mistake repeatedly, it helped me to sketch out what I needed to see and do everyday in one place. In Notion, that’s your dashboard(s) and databases. What do you need to see to get after it?\nThird, if you’re like me and want to have a space to be focused on the work but also a space to see your short and long term plans, it helps to make sure your end goals are clear. Once you know what you need and how you work, what are you doing this for? I needed a streamlined way to map out my day, ensure I was focused on the important or priority items, and a place to close out my day with a review and setup for the next day. This is important for two reasons; first, because having a daily start and stop ritual allows me to quiet my brain, and second, setting up the next day means I don’t spend time debating over where to get started and I can just start. Both of these things are crucial for me to make the progress towards the goals I want to achieve.\nNow that we’ve thought about what we want to get out of the Notion, their learning & resources content is extensive but YouTube is your best friend when setting up Notion. I’ve linked some of my favorite folks below - they are straight forward, scaffold from the easiest entry points up to more complex builds.\nI recommend watching some of the content from these creators to get started or learn more about some of Notion’s coolest features. \n Their pages: Frank Thomas Explains, Jeff Su, Better Creating, and Myra_irl\n\nDo’s & Dont’s\n\nDO start with the most basic setup you need to get started\n\nDON’T sink a ton of time world- building before you’ve tested it out\n\nDO spend time sketching out what you need\n\nDON’T buy templates unless they are absolutely everything you’ve ever wanted\n\nDO build a main dashboard and 1-2 pages to begin\n\nDON’T create a new page for everything or you’ll never find it properly again\n\nDO explore the automations and connections that can be made to your existing tools\n\nDON’T try to make everything fit into Notion\n\n\n\nDO set a trial period so you can assess what is working and what isn’t\n\nDON’T only open Notion to create the tool or tweak the tool\n\n\nGive Notion a test drive and tell me what you think! What do you like, dislike, or want to know more about?"

While most of what I needed to accomplish was not science related, rebuilding my science timelines and deliverables played a huge role in scheduling out the remainder of Autumn Quarter, assessing my goals, and building timelines that are attainable for my goals for the academic year; building in rest and off-days is also on the ‘must do’ list. While I may not reach candidacy at the close of Spring Quarter 2026, if I continue to manage my progress daily, I could reach it by late Summer Quarter 2026 or early Autumn Quarter 2026.\nPlanning out this far is a bit precarious as I don’t know what I don’t know, so along with the big steps, I am building a list of questions that will help me refine the goals and the steps to achieve them."

    "text": "Today’s Meeting is all about mussel reproduction, environmentally induced sex determinants and whatever is up with maternal and paternal mtDNA… cool stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the questions/ chapters we were kicking around last meeting:\n\nThe overarching theme is: Exploring xenobiotic effects and consequences in mussels (to mussel physiology)\n\nChapters 1 & 2 (my MS work) remain the biomarker and DNA methylation work, respectively\n\nCan the mussels from the WDFW Nearshore Monitoring Program be used to assess the impact of contaminants on the mussels using traditional biomarkers?\nCan epigenetics (DNA Methylation) be used to identify novel biomarkers of PAH exposure in mussels?\n\nChapter 3 is lab testing the results of the Chapter 2\n\nUtilize ‘new’ mussels to test the outcomes of the mussels that show differential methylation from Chapter 2.\nShort- term (1-3 month) and longer term (3-6 month) lab- based exposure and response experiments designed to characterize the metabolic threshold of mussels exposed to known contaminant mixtures that mimic those in Puget Sound.\n\nClarify stress induced DMLs and their pathways. Do they align with the DMLs in Chapter 2?\n\n\nChapter 4 is a larger synthesis of the knowledge gained in Chapters 2 and 3.\n\nWhat are the contaminants inducing in mussels that can have broader population or ecosystem implications?\n\nThis can be assessed through a variety of field- based experiments\n\nOutplanting primed and non-primed mussels to assess response at sites with higher or lower contaminant burdens.\nReciprocal outplanting - mussels outplanted at high contaminant sites are moved to sites with low contamination and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarger questions we’re kicking around to use as guides in creating the initial proposal (in addition to those above)\n\nDo epigenetics play a role in creating a phenotypic buffer that supports mussel acclimation/ resilience in the face of climate change drivers (xenobiotic exposure)?\nCan we define a tipping- point in mussel’s physiology and/ or their role in ecosystem health?\n\nIf there is a tipping point, to what degree does prior exposure create phenotypic response?\nWhat are the ecosystem- level consequences of foundational organisms reaching tipping points?\nWhat mechanisms control phenotypic response to prior exposures (aka epigenetic memory)?\n\nDo we actually have methylation described in mussels? What resources/ information is out there to support putting that picture together?\n\n\n\n\n\nNew (to me) Literature\nReviewing Mytilus trossulus genome literature, I came across a ton of cool papers that I want to discuss in the context of pollutant work, resilience, and hitting a knowledge gap that isn’t a chasm or a dead end. The 3 below are just a few that are interesting to me.\n\n[Paper 1: Breton et al. (2006) Comparative analysis of gender-associated complete mtDNA genomes in marine mussels] (https://github.com/ChrisMantegna/labnotebook/blob/main/resources/Breton%20et%20al.%20-%202006%20-%20Comparative%20Analysis%20of%20Gender-Associated%20Complete%20Mitochondrial%20Genomes%20in%20Marine%20Mussels%20(%20Myti.pdf)\nPaper 2: Breton et al. (2021) Did doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) of mtDNA originate as a cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system?\nPaper 3: Chelyadina et al. (2022) Effects of heavy metals on sex inversion of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in coastal zone of the Black Sea\n\n\n\nSome questions that are coming up\n\nDo we know why the paternal mtDNA is more degraded than the maternal mtDNA and found dominantly in male offspring?\nHave we seen anything to indicate the population ratios around PS during or after the marine heat waves?\nIs it ethical (assuming they live long enough) to expose mussels to contaminants (heavy metals maybe) induce spawning and sex change and see if there is a difference in methylation patterns?"
