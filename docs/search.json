    "text": "Progress Makes a PhD\n\nMy Graduate Work in the Roberts’ Lab at the University of Washington\nStraddling the line between classic ecological methods and cutting- edge molecular techniques, I am building my marine science foundation as a Marine Molecular Ecologist studying nearshore ecosystems in Puget Sound and the greater Salish Sea. While my graduate work is dominantly focused on conservation ecology, it can also be readily applied to aquaculture and sustainable food systems. The stars of the show are marine invertebrates, mostly foundational species like mussels, but I also incorporate the exploration of the relationship dynamics between human and non-human kin. Ultimately, I want to understand how human-induced environmental changes influence nearshore communities at different scales from the organismal and ecosystem level."

    "text": "Started with a re-run of my site comparisons for the biomarkers. I was writing the results and trying to make some sense of what wasn’t sitting right, and it turns out that if you aren’t using the correct df in your code, you get a p-value of 0.478 for every single metric you are looking at when trying to understand if there are differences by site…\nAlison and I met to talk about the paper and how we’re going to get the manuscript ready for the WIMS x ICB submission window time frame. I felt really good about it and I believe she’s cautiously optimistic that we’ll make it!\nI had a wonderful conversation with Chelsea Wood today - scheduled - to discuss how to start curating my science brand and where to focus my professional development so that I’m not trying to slam in all of the work in my final year when I’m trying to apply for positions.\nI ended the day working on pulling lit on the efficacy of conservation ecology work. This proved to be very difficult to find since the dominant result was either about engineering, the role of specific species, or commentary on how conservation practices should work. I made a log of search terms, platforms, results returned and added about 30 papers that get close to my topic, but this is still not working as I wanted.\n\nUltimately, this makes me question how we get the siloed work of individual organizations aligned with the ‘big data’ that is being collected, or how we gain access or clarity around the data and action of the organizations. Trying to clarify the efficacy of conservation efforts is challenging, especially when we all define efficacy a bit different."

I added the tasks to my Notion management setup, separated in quick tasks and anything that will take longer than 30 minutes so I could manage getting a few things done where I can rather than try to knock out big chunks at a time.\n\nMy primary work (deep work) focused on getting back to the biomarker work I set down before leaving for the summer. I reviewed my most recent analysis notes, the questions/ comments I made for myself, and then the analyses. I had a hard time evaluating what was most important to tackle first, so I spent some time listing out my decisions to get to the end analyses and what result mapped to what choice before I could really get my head back in the game. This helped me identify an error in my contaminant indices and note that I needed to re-link the curated literature review to the draft in the methods and discussion drafting."

That meeting will be between 10/7 - 10/17.\nI sent my ‘degree work’ explainer over to Manca. She is helping to connect me to her former colleagues at WWU, so I needed to write a paragraph about my work and ultimate dissertation topic for her to send - that took me a surprisingly long time to craft. That flagged my need to clarify my work in both my mind and in how I share it - part of my personal goals for the year.\nI spent the rest of my science admin time assessing and mapping my deliverables for the bypass package and working to identify where I will need help.\n\nMy biomarker work was in mapping my plots for the manuscript and trying to get some of those plots to look better. Even when plotting by site (74 of them) the plots are a bit crowded, so I was working on that."

Is it effective? How do we know?\n\nScoped to historical efficacy, collegiate preparation and inclusion, and new data techniques to bring together all the pertinent information to make decisions.\nLooking through the data and practitioners - not policy even though I will have to address \n\nWhat teaching methods will support the learning and research for the next group of conservationists?\nWhere are the new and the established conservationists aligned or mismatched with current conservation professionals?\n\nSocial expectation - changes in workload versus personal time, work ethic?, compensation, and societal acceptance or celebration of the work\nEducational expectation - what skills are new folks coming in with, is it mismatched to what is needed, how does the UG degree provide (or not) the skills to be successful, and is there commentary on how that has changed over time?\nUrgency - efficacy is the question of the hour as we are losing time to ‘reverse’ or ‘stop’ change. Can we stop it, should we stop it, and how does multiple knowledge systems’ incorporation into the application of the data (and how its gathered) alter or confirm the future of conservation?\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Assumptions\n\nAssessing the nearshore environment from ecosystem level to organismal impact is thorough but incomplete without considering how the human element impacts the ecosystem.\nConservation Ecology is the end focus - what can my work do to bring together/ or bridge the existing data, identify where data is incomplete, or support the folks who want data-driven actions/ solutions to conservation\nWe are not working with micro-plastics. Contamination work is the only axis of alteration we are assessing directly.\n\n\n\nThings to Consider\n\nWhere are the gaps in my approach?\nCan I launch an eDNA bio blitz where WDFW is outplanting the mussels if we find interesting correlations from the biomarker work and the DNA methylation work?\nWhat are the other axes of human impact in conservation ecology that I’m overlooking OR need to address?"
