    "text": "Progress Makes a PhD\n\nMy Graduate Work in the Roberts’ Lab at the University of Washington\nStraddling the line between classic ecological methods and cutting- edge molecular techniques, I am building my marine science foundation as a Marine Molecular Ecologist studying nearshore ecosystems in Puget Sound and the greater Salish Sea. While my graduate work is dominantly focused on conservation ecology, it can also be readily applied to aquaculture and sustainable food systems. The stars of the show are marine invertebrates, mostly foundational species like mussels, but I also incorporate the exploration of the relationship dynamics between human and non-human kin. Ultimately, I want to understand how human-induced environmental changes influence nearshore communities at different scales from the organismal and ecosystem level."

    "text": "I had the great fortune of collaborating with the University of Minnesota (UMN) and the National Museums of Kenya (KMN) in July and August to conduct field work that supported expanding our limited academic knowledge of Mormyrids, a weakly electric fish with a population in Lake Victoria, Kenya. Under the guidance of PI Kassie Ford, UMN Professor and Bell Museum Curator, we worked in direct collaboration with the ichthyologists at KMN to procure samples of as many species of mormyrids as we could for addition to the KMN fish collection and further projects amongst our respective institutions. My role, as the only non-ichthyologist, was to collect water and sediment samples for eDNA analysis to build a snapshot of the trophic composition of Lake Victoria and it’s estuaries along with collecting stomach contents from multiple species at each site to support the mormyrid diet analysis assesment of MS student Kassi Price.\nWe spent over a month visiting sites around the lake between the Tanzanian and Ugandan border (as well as the rivers that fed into the lake) collecting samples and assessing basic water quality (temperature, pH, salinity, etc), habitat differences, and watching over our shoulders for crocodiles and hippos! Ultimately, we used a variety of techniques and employed the support of local fishermen to expand our limited knowledge and help us reach our sampling goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt every single location we were greeted by people who were interested in our work. Dominantly children, but plenty of adults that helped us gain knowledge about the area, where to find certain fishes, and the best places to avoid conflict with wildlife. It was an incredibly welcoming and enthusiastic environment to work in. Most hilarious was the constant shouts of ‘Mzungu’ when local folks saw us in our vehicle or in the rivers or lake. It loosely means ‘European person’, but as we soon found out it essentially means anyone who is not from Kenya. It was really fun to talk with everyone as they were as interested in us as we were in them - it made long field days that much more enjoyable.\nAs we wrapped up our work and headed back to Nairobi, we parted ways with our KNM collaborators and closed our trip with a 3 day safari in Masai Mara National Park. To say it is as magical as you expect and more is an understatement. I know everyone loves the big cats, but my favorites were the zebras and the wildebeests.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe saw so many animals I had only seen in books or in zoos! Truth be told, the fish were cool, but this was a bucket list, once in a lifetime opportunity that I cannot get over. I am excited to be contributing to the body of knowledge around Lake Victoria by providing a baseline community composition in the dry season; something that doesn’t exist for any season, but I am most proud of the relationships we’re building, the future collaborations to come, and another opportunity to visit Kenya."

    "text": "Started with a re-run of my site comparisons for the biomarkers. I was writing the results and trying to make some sense of what wasn’t sitting right, and it turns out that if you aren’t using the correct df in your code, you get a p-value of 0.478 for every single metric you are looking at when trying to understand if there are differences by site…\nAlison and I met to talk about the paper and how we’re going to get the manuscript ready for the WIMS x ICB submission window time frame. I felt really good about it and I believe she’s cautiously optimistic that we’ll make it!\nI had a wonderful conversation with Chelsea Wood today - scheduled - to discuss how to start curating my science brand and where to focus my professional development so that I’m not trying to slam in all of the work in my final year when I’m trying to apply for positions.\nI ended the day working on pulling lit on the efficacy of conservation ecology work. This proved to be very difficult to find since the dominant result was either about engineering, the role of specific species, or commentary on how conservation practices should work. I made a log of search terms, platforms, results returned and added about 30 papers that get close to my topic, but this is still not working as I wanted.\n\nUltimately, this makes me question how we get the siloed work of individual organizations aligned with the ‘big data’ that is being collected, or how we gain access or clarity around the data and action of the organizations. Trying to clarify the efficacy of conservation efforts is challenging, especially when we all define efficacy a bit different."

I added the tasks to my Notion management setup, separated in quick tasks and anything that will take longer than 30 minutes so I could manage getting a few things done where I can rather than try to knock out big chunks at a time.\n\nMy primary work (deep work) focused on getting back to the biomarker work I set down before leaving for the summer. I reviewed my most recent analysis notes, the questions/ comments I made for myself, and then the analyses. I had a hard time evaluating what was most important to tackle first, so I spent some time listing out my decisions to get to the end analyses and what result mapped to what choice before I could really get my head back in the game. This helped me identify an error in my contaminant indices and note that I needed to re-link the curated literature review to the draft in the methods and discussion drafting."

That meeting will be between 10/7 - 10/17.\nI sent my ‘degree work’ explainer over to Manca. She is helping to connect me to her former colleagues at WWU, so I needed to write a paragraph about my work and ultimate dissertation topic for her to send - that took me a surprisingly long time to craft. That flagged my need to clarify my work in both my mind and in how I share it - part of my personal goals for the year.\nI spent the rest of my science admin time assessing and mapping my deliverables for the bypass package and working to identify where I will need help.\n\nMy biomarker work was in mapping my plots for the manuscript and trying to get some of those plots to look better. Even when plotting by site (74 of them) the plots are a bit crowded, so I was working on that."

The research assumptions and questions below are where I think it works.\nMy goal is to have a working presentation to you for review by COB on 10/07.\n\nWill build based on how we adjust the questions/ assumptions below\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\nWhat is the community composition of the nearshore ecosystem in Puget Sound?\n\nAre there any temporal similarities or differences across the sound? Anything not expected?\nCan we identify any trends that point toward resilience or adverse response to human impacts? \n\nWhat is the impact of legacy contaminants and heavy metals on foundational nearshore organisms?\n\nHow does regional (and nationally established and backed) biennial monitoring support conservation strategy development in Puget Sound?\nCan that monitoring model be leveraged to also infer organismal impact?\n\nIf so, does organismal impact align with the contamination profiles at each monitored site?\n\n\nHow do we identify data-driven opportunities in conservation ecology and utilize those to prepare the next generation of conservation ecologists?\n\nWhat is the current state of conservation ecology? Is it effective? How do we know?\n\nScoped to historical efficacy, collegiate preparation and inclusion, and new data techniques to bring together all the pertinent information to make decisions.\nLooking through the data and practitioners - not policy even though I will have to address \n\nWhat teaching methods will support the learning and research for the next group of conservationists?\nWhere are the new and the established conservationists aligned or mismatched with current conservation professionals?\n\nSocial expectation - changes in workload versus personal time, work ethic?, compensation, and societal acceptance or celebration of the work\nEducational expectation - what skills are new folks coming in with, is it mismatched to what is needed, how does the UG degree provide (or not) the skills to be successful, and is there commentary on how that has changed over time?\nUrgency - efficacy is the question of the hour as we are losing time to ‘reverse’ or ‘stop’ change. Can we stop it, should we stop it, and how does multiple knowledge systems’ incorporation into the application of the data (and how its gathered) alter or confirm the future of conservation?\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Assumptions\n\nAssessing the nearshore environment from ecosystem level to organismal impact is thorough but incomplete without considering how the human element impacts the ecosystem.\nConservation Ecology is the end focus - what can my work do to bring together/ or bridge the existing data, identify where data is incomplete, or support the folks who want data-driven actions/ solutions to conservation\nWe are not working with micro-plastics. Contamination work is the only axis of alteration we are assessing directly.\n\n\n\nThings to Consider\n\nWhere are the gaps in my approach?\nCan I launch an eDNA bio blitz where WDFW is outplanting the mussels if we find interesting correlations from the biomarker work and the DNA methylation work?\nWhat are the other axes of human impact in conservation ecology that I’m overlooking OR need to address?"

    "text": "This page compiles all daily posts for 2025-09.\n\n\n2025-09-24 — New AY, New Set Up\nIn true to me fashion, a new academic year means a new notebook setup that will hopefully make it a bit easier for me to update my work daily. Today’s science focus was on rebuilding, updating and launching my 2025-26 AY lab notebook. Related, I made a ‘sprint’ task list for quick tasks I can do to tighten up my GitHub setup, cleanup my repos, and identify any pinch points for making a daily update. My second focus was to setup weekly meetings with my PI and gather materials for my first meeting on 9.25.25.\n\n\n2025-09-25 — Put Your $$ Where Your Mouth Is\n\nToday’s work fell in the broad category of preparing for lab meeting and the subsequent 1v1 with Steven. My main takeaways are to set explicit goals that we will share and work on in biweekly lab meetings.\n\nMy goal for next lab working session is to have one of my three bypass chapters complete to the standard of the package and the other two fully outlined.\n\nMeeting with Steven post lab meeting we agreed that my AY goal, to become a candidate by the end of the year, is big but doable as long as I stay accountable to myself. Additionally, my deliverable from the meeting is to complete the SAFS milestones form and get it back to him by the end of the week.\n\n\n\n2025-09-26 — Biomarkers, Back Again\n\nMy work today started with a quick audit of my GH repos and what should be cleaned up as I move forward. I added the tasks to my Notion management setup, separated in quick tasks and anything that will take longer than 30 minutes so I could manage getting a few things done where I can rather than try to knock out big chunks at a time.\n\nMy primary work (deep work) focused on getting back to the biomarker work I set down before leaving for the summer. I reviewed my most recent analysis notes, the questions/ comments I made for myself, and then the analyses. I had a hard time evaluating what was most important to tackle first, so I spent some time listing out my decisions to get to the end analyses and what result mapped to what choice before I could really get my head back in the game. This helped me identify an error in my contaminant indices and note that I needed to re-link the curated literature review to the draft in the methods and discussion drafting.\n\n\n\n2025-09-27 — Day Off\nNo science work was done today.\n\n\n2025-09-28 — Biomarkers Literature Reconciliation\n\nAll of today’s focus was in tidying up my notes and citations for the biomarker manuscript draft. I have left notes or comments for myself that are a little cryptic, or worse, tags that aren’t as descriptive as I need. The goal was to ensure I have the right citations in the right places and identify anything that needs additional depth in citations (biomarker work is rich in practitioners) or needs a citation period. This took much longer than I anticipated, so I knocked off for the day after that.\n\n\n\n2025-09-29 — Bypass & Biomarkers\n\nMost of today’s work focused on my science task management.\n\nI completed the overdue milestones in the new SAFS tracker. As soon as my committee signs the Docusigm, I can submit that and get off the ‘bad kids list’.\nI sent out the scheduler for my first committee meeting of the quarter. That meeting will be between 10/7 - 10/17.\nI sent my ‘degree work’ explainer over to Manca. She is helping to connect me to her former colleagues at WWU, so I needed to write a paragraph about my work and ultimate dissertation topic for her to send - that took me a surprisingly long time to craft. That flagged my need to clarify my work in both my mind and in how I share it - part of my personal goals for the year.\nI spent the rest of my science admin time assessing and mapping my deliverables for the bypass package and working to identify where I will need help.\n\nMy biomarker work was in mapping my plots for the manuscript and trying to get some of those plots to look better. Even when plotting by site (74 of them) the plots are a bit crowded, so I was working on that.\n\n\n\n2025-09-30 — It’s Epigenetics, Baby\n\nTuesdays are typically days where minimal science will be done since my student assistance-ship is the dominant player, but for at least one hour every week this quarter I’ll get some science in there!\n\nSteven’s class focused on epigenetics is a literature review class where we learn foundational concepts in the discipline and then bring our own interesting literature to present while interacting with what implications this information could have on our own work.\nToday was the first class, so it was a familiarization, a chance to read a foundational paper, and work test run the GitHub workflow for the course."

I added the tasks to my Notion management setup, separated in quick tasks and anything that will take longer than 30 minutes so I could manage getting a few things done where I can rather than try to knock out big chunks at a time.\n\nMy primary work (deep work) focused on getting back to the biomarker work I set down before leaving for the summer. I reviewed my most recent analysis notes, the questions/ comments I made for myself, and then the analyses. I had a hard time evaluating what was most important to tackle first, so I spent some time listing out my decisions to get to the end analyses and what result mapped to what choice before I could really get my head back in the game. This helped me identify an error in my contaminant indices and note that I needed to re-link the curated literature review to the draft in the methods and discussion drafting."

He gave me advice on how to frame that and we wrapped up for the day.\nI spent some time this evening working on the framing of my bypass presentation for my October 9th committee meeting\nWrapped up the day with work on the biomarker analysis. The correlations seem to be far higher in number of significant results than when I previously worked on it, so I needed to investigate. Turns out I created a loop that was correlating the wrong variables. Fixed that."

    "text": "Attended lab meeting where we shared our bi-weekly goals, progress, knowledge nuggets, and upcoming goals. My responses are below. My goals are built off of my Autumn quarter goals/ plan to meet those goals.\nI worked on my bypass presentation for my committee meeting on Thursday.\n\n\nNotes from 10.06.2025 Lab Meeting\n\nGoals set on 9/25/25: Have one chapter of my PhD proposal drafted and the others outlined.\n\nProgress as of 10/06/25\nAfter dusting off the docs and taking an inventory of where each of the pieces stand, I have the 3 PhD chapters outlined and pivoted to working on my first MS chapter. I chose to shift away from the PhD proposal focus so that I could knock out the MS chapter since it is my required manuscript for the package and needs to be reviewed/ approved by both the committee and WDFW.\n\n\nMy knowledge nuggets all center around things I’m using to maximize my working time and reduce the number of ‘administrative’ tasks I need to do to get rolling on the real work.\n\n\n1st- the Graduate School Funding Guide has a huge database (GFIS) of funding opportunities that you can search, download into a csv and explore on your own time. It also has the college-wide Assistantships database you can explore. There are dedicated support resources through the library if you have questions.\n2nd- If you use Zotero and want to clean up your literature review process, link it to something like Notion or any other organizational platform that supports integration and keep all of your notes and annotations in one place. This video from The Grad School Coach shows you how to integrate Notion & Zotero, and this video from Aynur Science on how to create a literature review workflow using Notion that supports information recall.\n3rd- Wondering where your time is going? I did my own time trials using Toggl this summer to see how long my most frequent tasks (reading and annotating a paper, coding plots, setting up data cleaning scripts, etc.) take me to complete so that I could better schedule my day and not demoralize myself when I’m not meeting my productivity goals. I used daily to track my time, help me build my weekly time blocking schedules, and review where I’m getting lost, and as a bonus, I can see just how much work on each project I am putting in and how to adjust for the upcoming week. Toggl is platform that you can use for free, but there are paid upgrades if you want them. I’ve been using it since July and haven’t needed to upgrade at all, all of the free functions are great.\n\n\nGoals set on 10/06 for completion by 10/20 lab meeting:\n1. Finish the biomarker manuscript 10/9\n2. Finish the committee meeting presentation 10/9\n3. Complete draft of my MS thesis 10/14\n4. Create bench protocol for Kenya samples 10/20"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Notion has been a management and organization tool that I have been using on and off for the last 6 years, and finally this year I have hit my stride with the platform. This week’s wrap-up is about how I use Notion to manage my day to day responsibilities and how to avoid some of the mistakes I’ve made along the way.\nMost important to remember about the platform is that it is a tool that is typically aligned with productivity and project management, but the thousands of users and the seemingly unlimited customization abilities of Notion can make it whatever you want from a whole life management tool to a simple task manager.\n\n\nSince most folks use it as a life or project management tool, the setups align with a few titans in the productivity space. I’ve listed a few of them and their books below.\n\nGetting Things Done (GTD) — David Allen\nBuilding a Second Brain — Tiago Forte\nAtomic Habits — James Clear\nDeep Work — Cal Newport\nThe Bullet Journal Method — Ryder Carroll\nThe 12-Week Year — Brian Moran & Michael Lennington\nYou may notice that the productivity space that guides a lot of this is male- dominated… do not be fooled the Notion girlies (and our non-binary builders) are what turns a simple system from a rigid practice to a flexible tool with a little pizzazz to keep you coming back to using it! More impactful, I found several of the concepts in the books to be less intuitive than I would like and the Notion girlies came through with great ways to help me think about adapting the systems to how my life works.\nGetting started on the platform is free and 99% of the platform’s functionality is available at the free tier. There are paid tiers and a free pro account if you are a student. I believe the limitation between a free versus paid account is in the storage space, but I haven’t encountered a problem. In addition, there are tons of free templates to get you rolling if you want some inspiration before building your own pages.\n\n\nThere are a few things to consider before you go down the rabbit hole, and those are having a clear vision of what you want to use Notion for, identifying what in your current system is and is not aligned, and finally, how can Notion support you in meeting your goals rather than create a distraction or friction point in your process. Let me explain what I mean.\n\nFirst, you have to decide is what you want to use Notion to do - is it replacing other management software, consolidating a multi-tool workflow that isn’t working, or do you want it to integrate into a system you are already using? I use it as the single place I operate my day-to-day from; multiple responsibilities for me means multiple ways I can lose myself in task switching and that tanks my productivity. I was looking for a way to help me integrate the parts of my workflow that were working and help me set up a place where I could manage the pieces that weren’t. For example, I love to use my Notes app to keep running to-do lists, drop thoughts or ideas, or make quick reminders to myself. The problem is that there’s no tracking, connection to the larger project the idea or task relates to, and no way to see if I’ve already dropped this brain bit into its project or calendar or whatever and that is frustrating. It felt like I was doing triple work just to get everything aligned and that led to task overwhelm and progress stunting.\nSecond, think about your working style. Notion can be as standardized or bespoke as you’d like it to be - everyone has some new way to get it done, and if you aren’t sure what you’re trying to do and how you work, you will surely create something that creates more work than it is worth. For example, I keep a working log of notes in my Google Drive for each project and I thought maybe I would transition it to the Notion projects I built - it was more hassle than it was worth since it upended the habit I built by not matching the functionality or flexibility I need for that task. To combat making that mistake repeatedly, it helped me to sketch out what I needed to see and do everyday in one place. In Notion, that’s your dashboard(s) and databases. What do you need to see to get after it?\nThird, if you’re like me and want to have a space to be focused on the work but also a space to see your short and long term plans, it helps to make sure your end goals are clear. Once you know what you need and how you work, what are you doing this for? I needed a streamlined way to map out my day, ensure I was focused on the important or priority items, and a place to close out my day with a review and setup for the next day. This is important for two reasons; first, because having a daily start and stop ritual allows me to quiet my brain, and second, setting up the next day means I don’t spend time debating over where to get started and I can just start. Both of these things are crucial for me to make the progress towards the goals I want to achieve.\nNow that we’ve thought about what we want to get out of the Notion, their learning & resources content is extensive but YouTube is your best friend when setting up Notion. I’ve linked some of my favorite folks below - they are straight forward, scaffold from the easiest entry points up to more complex builds.\nI recommend watching some of the content from these creators to get started or learn more about some of Notion’s coolest features. \n Their pages: Frank Thomas Explains, Jeff Su, Better Creating, and Myra_irl\n\nDo’s & Dont’s\n\nDO start with the most basic setup you need to get started\n\nDON’T sink a ton of time world- building before you’ve tested it out\n\nDO spend time sketching out what you need\n\nDON’T buy templates unless they are absolutely everything you’ve ever wanted\n\nDO build a main dashboard and 1-2 pages to begin\n\nDON’T create a new page for everything or you’ll never find it properly again\n\nDO explore the automations and connections that can be made to your existing tools\n\nDON’T try to make everything fit into Notion\n\n\n\nDO set a trial period so you can assess what is working and what isn’t\n\nDON’T only open Notion to create the tool or tweak the tool\n\n\nGive Notion a test drive and tell me what you think! What do you like, dislike, or want to know more about?"

I did quick searches on Web of Science and Google Scholar for epigenetic work done in the ecotoxicology discipline, and while the results were limited, there was a ton of opinions in how epigenetics can be used as a tool to support understanding of the impact of legacy contaminants in foundational model organisms.\n\nI am part of the team of submitters for the PromethION proposal. Today I helped with the final reading/ editing and it looks great. Mike has knocked it out of the park and I hope this comes to fruition."

We’ll refine as we move forward, and as I learn to read my own handwriting a little better!\nThe overarching theme is: Exploring xenobiotic effects and consequences in mussels (to mussel physiology)\n\nChapters 1 & 2 (my MS work) remain the biomarker and DNA methylation work, respectively\n\nCan the mussels from the WDFW Nearshore Monitoring Program be used to assess the impact of contaminants on the mussels using traditional biomarkers?\nCan epigenetics (DNA Methylation) be used to identify novel biomarkers of PAH exposure in mussels?\n\nChapter 3 is lab testing the results of the Chapter 2\n\nUtilize ‘new’ mussels to test the outcomes of the mussels that show differential methylation from Chapter 2.\nShort- term (1-3 month) and longer term (3-6 month) lab- based exposure and response experiments designed to characterize the metabolic threshold of mussels exposed to known contaminant mixtures that mimic those in Puget Sound.\n\nClarify stress induced DMLs and their pathways. Do they align with the DMLs in Chapter 2?\n\n\nChapter 4 is a larger synthesis of the knowledge gained in Chapters 2 and 3.\n\nWhat are the contaminants inducing in mussels that can have broader population or ecosystem implications?\n\nThis can be assessed through a variety of field- based experiments\n\nOutplanting primed and non-primed mussels to assess response at sites with higher or lower contaminant burdens.\nReciprocal outplanting - mussels outplanted at high contaminant sites are moved to sites with low contamination and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\nLarger questions we’re kicking around to use as guides in creating the initial proposal (in addition to those above)\n\nDo epigenetics play a role in creating a phenotypic buffer that supports mussel acclimation/ resilience in the face of climate change drivers (xenobiotic exposure)?\nCan we define a tipping- point in mussel’s physiology and/ or their role in ecosystem health?\n\nIf there is a tipping point, to what degree does prior exposure create phenotypic response?\nWhat are the ecosystem- level consequences of foundational organisms reaching tipping points?\nWhat mechanisms control phenotypic response to prior exposures (aka epigenetic memory)?\n\nDo we actually have methylation described in mussels? What resources/ information is out there to support putting that picture together?"

I felt really good about it and I believe she’s cautiously optimistic that we’ll make it!\nI had a wonderful conversation with Chelsea Wood today - scheduled - to discuss how to start curating my science brand and where to focus my professional development so that I’m not trying to slam in all of the work in my final year when I’m trying to apply for positions.\nI ended the day working on pulling lit on the efficacy of conservation ecology work. This proved to be very difficult to find since the dominant result was either about engineering, the role of specific species, or commentary on how conservation practices should work. I made a log of search terms, platforms, results returned and added about 30 papers that get close to my topic, but this is still not working as I wanted.\n\nUltimately, this makes me question how we get the siloed work of individual organizations aligned with the ‘big data’ that is being collected, or how we gain access or clarity around the data and action of the organizations. Trying to clarify the efficacy of conservation efforts is challenging, especially when we all define efficacy a bit different.\n\n\n\n\n2025-10-02 — Biomarkers & Mentorship, Part Duex\n\nKicked off today by updating my lab notebook daily entries. I forgot to update my reminder to continue past the previous week, so fixed that as well.\nI organized my 1v1 agenda and got it rendered into a notebook post so Steven knows what we’re chatting about later today.\nMet with my friend and fellow SAFS grad student, Maddie. We set up some co- working blocks, talked through our respective projects and bounced ideas off of each other for improvements, suggestions and overall vibes.\nMet with Julia to discuss managing multiple projects, getting the writing done, and meeting grad milestones met without going insane.\nMet with Steven to go over my framing of my bypass package. He was on-board with the big picture but there is some places where I can more explicitly shore up the expansion. He gave me advice on how to frame that and we wrapped up for the day.\nI spent some time this evening working on the framing of my bypass presentation for my October 9th committee meeting\nWrapped up the day with work on the biomarker analysis. The correlations seem to be far higher in number of significant results than when I previously worked on it, so I needed to investigate. Turns out I created a loop that was correlating the wrong variables. Fixed that.\n\n\n\n2025-10-03 — Course work & Biomarkers\n\nScience solidly fell into task management and project analysis review today.\n\nFirst, I read over the papers for this week’s FISH 510 and setup my course project in Notion. I added my deadlines, deliverables and tasks and linked the literature for the course to the full project page.\nSecond, I started answering the Discussion Questions for the week and looking ahead to the upcoming week. The goal is to post responses to the discussion questions for the following week by Thursday of the week we’re in. I missed the mark this week, but it shouldn’t be difficult moving forward.\n\nI worked on wrapping up the biomarker analysis validation and documenting what steps and decisions I made in data manipulation, statistical analysis choices, and my interpretations of the individual results while thinking through what the results mean all together.\n\n\n\n2025-10-04 — Reading, Reading & More Reading\n\nAll science today was in the reading and re-reading of the literature behind the biomarker work. I have a Zotero project with almost 100 papers in it that are at various levels of annotation and note taking. Not ideal.\n\nI updated my sync to Notion by removing the complete project, selecting the papers I knew were 100% going to be cited, and then started triaging the mess I made to date.\nNext, I made a holding folder for papers that may support very specific analysis decisions and papers that will support specific text in the manuscript.\nFinally, I refined my note taking template to make the necessary information visible in a database in Notion so that when I want to review all papers supporting methods or my introduction or whatever, I can just sort and see my notes rather than have to open and close each individual entry to create another document that can get lost.\n\n\n\n\n2025-10-05 — Fish 510 & Writing\n\nI returned to the FISH 510 coursework first today. I completed my notes for the Week 2 papers, answered the discussion questions and got my posts and responses to others up on the discussion board.\nI finished the day by brain dumping my thoughts from my biomarker lit reconciliation. I moved pieces into their respective manuscript sections, aligned any citations that related, and tried to pull out the important pieces that keep the doc moving forward without my desire to wax poetic about the whole thing.\n\n\n\n2025-10-06 — Booked & Busy\n\nAttended lab meeting where we shared our bi-weekly goals, progress, knowledge nuggets, and upcoming goals. My responses are below. My goals are built off of my Autumn quarter goals/ plan to meet those goals.\nI worked on my bypass presentation for my committee meeting on Thursday.\n\n\nNotes from 10.06.2025 Lab Meeting\n\nGoals set on 9/25/25: Have one chapter of my PhD proposal drafted and the others outlined.\n\nProgress as of 10/06/25\nAfter dusting off the docs and taking an inventory of where each of the pieces stand, I have the 3 PhD chapters outlined and pivoted to working on my first MS chapter. I chose to shift away from the PhD proposal focus so that I could knock out the MS chapter since it is my required manuscript for the package and needs to be reviewed/ approved by both the committee and WDFW.\n\n\nMy knowledge nuggets all center around things I’m using to maximize my working time and reduce the number of ‘administrative’ tasks I need to do to get rolling on the real work.\n\n\n1st- the Graduate School Funding Guide has a huge database (GFIS) of funding opportunities that you can search, download into a csv and explore on your own time. It also has the college-wide Assistantships database you can explore. There are dedicated support resources through the library if you have questions.\n2nd- If you use Zotero and want to clean up your literature review process, link it to something like Notion or any other organizational platform that supports integration and keep all of your notes and annotations in one place. This video from The Grad School Coach shows you how to integrate Notion & Zotero, and this video from Aynur Science on how to create a literature review workflow using Notion that supports information recall.\n3rd- Wondering where your time is going? I did my own time trials using Toggl this summer to see how long my most frequent tasks (reading and annotating a paper, coding plots, setting up data cleaning scripts, etc.) take me to complete so that I could better schedule my day and not demoralize myself when I’m not meeting my productivity goals. I used daily to track my time, help me build my weekly time blocking schedules, and review where I’m getting lost, and as a bonus, I can see just how much work on each project I am putting in and how to adjust for the upcoming week. Toggl is platform that you can use for free, but there are paid upgrades if you want them. I’ve been using it since July and haven’t needed to upgrade at all, all of the free functions are great.\n\n\nGoals set on 10/06 for completion by 10/20 lab meeting:\n1. Finish the biomarker manuscript 10/9\n2. Finish the committee meeting presentation 10/9\n3. Complete draft of my MS thesis 10/14\n4. Create bench protocol for Kenya samples 10/20\n\n\n\n\n2025-10-07 — Tasks\n\nToday’s work was limited to task completion. Tuesday’s are fully RUA days so science is limited anyway, but it was more limited today because I had a previously scheduled obligation that wiped out any deep thinking/ deep work time.\nI attended fish 510 and confirmed I will be giving the week 4 presentation on my epigenetic topic of interest.\nI continued work on my bypass presentation, just shifted it over to quarto so that it is a notebook post.\n\n\n\n2025-10-08 — T-24 hours\n\nThe name of the game is get that damn presentation together, out and reviewed by Steven before tomorrow. The bulk of my time has been spent on that.\nI met with Logan today to discuss how to set up interviews for grad schools and some timeline planning for when/ how she is knocking out the major written portions for applications and grant applications.\nI worked with KPJ today on re-familiarizing myself with the biomarker manuscript graveyard - should make it easier for me to jump back in to the work tomorrow when time is less of a constriction.\n\n\n\n2025-10-09 — PhD Bound…\n\nToday’s only goal was to make it through my committee meeting and come through the other side with a plan. It didn’t go as expected, but I do have a plan. After the meeting, I re-confirmed with Sam that I did in fact have one quarter of funding remaining - I do, and then I continued on with my non-science responsibilities to wrap up the day.\n\n\n\n2025-10-10 — Reworking the Work\n\nToday was another heavy task management day versus a deep work day. I started by knocking out my readings and posts for FISH 510 next week. I pivoted to writing time for the biomarker manuscript, and then wrapped up the day by re-framing my bypass package proposals so that I could make a plan to get the work done as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n2025-10-11 — Notebooks and Notes Management\n\nI started the day by consolidating all of my noted for the week re: my daily notebook posts and dropping them into the actual digital lab notebook.\nNext I moved into writing for the biomarker manuscript. I started with citing the sources for my methods and then worked on the introduction. My results section is still a bullet-point list, but won’t be tomorrow when I can sort how to get the results chopped down into a shorter section.\n\n\n\n2025-10-12 — Biomarkers\n\nToday was all about knocking the dust off of all of my writing notes and re-running my result plots to get on with the show. I spent time reviewing the results, burning down the introduction draft and reworking the writing to more succinctly match the purpose of the research, plotting the draft versions of the figures, and thinking through what my next steps are to get this thing out to Alison and Steven before I die.\n\n\n\n2025-10-13 — No Science Today\n\nThere was no true science work completed today.\n\n\n\n2025-10-14 — Coursework\n\nTuesday’s are typically non-science days due to the length of time I spend in meetings and working on the RUA program. Today’s only science related work was attending class, adding my papers for next week to the class GitHub, and chatting with Steven about shifting my bypass package submission back to Winter Quarter instead of pushing to submit in November. We’re on the same page, so moving forward I will get the biomarkers paper out, work on my MS proposal, and continue to build my PhD proposal with the notes from my committee meeting in mind.\n\n\n\n2025-10-15 — Ecotox\n\nI started off the day reviewing the papers I pulled last night for my PhD proposal. I did quick searches on Web of Science and Google Scholar for epigenetic work done in the ecotoxicology discipline, and while the results were limited, there was a ton of opinions in how epigenetics can be used as a tool to support understanding of the impact of legacy contaminants in foundational model organisms.\n\nI am part of the team of submitters for the PromethION proposal. Today I helped with the final reading/ editing and it looks great. Mike has knocked it out of the park and I hope this comes to fruition.\n\n\n\n2025-10-16 — Usual Thursday Shenanigans\n\nToday’s work consisted of reviewing my notes through my initial literature search to refine a few options for re-framing my dissertation and preparing to work through those ideas with Steven during our 1v1. My plan was a little too in the weeds, but I think we came up with a solid plan for moving forward.\n\n\n\n2025-10-17 — Coursework & Planning\n\nI have spent my science- focused time continuing my work on my PhD proposal and bypass timeline re-work. Looking at the plan Steven and I worked on yesterday, I mapped a few big questions and plans to test them so that we can have a productive 1v1 next week.\nMy next priority was finishing my readings for FISH 510 and outlining my presentation. I got my discussion post up and created a slide catastrophe of ideas that I’ll refine over the weekend.\n\n\n\n2025-10-18 — Timelines & Tasks\n\nToday has been a heavy re-organization day. While most of what I needed to accomplish was not science related, rebuilding my science timelines and deliverables played a huge role in scheduling out the remainder of Autumn Quarter, assessing my goals, and building timelines that are attainable for my goals for the academic year; building in rest and off-days is also on the ‘must do’ list. While I may not reach candidacy at the close of Spring Quarter 2026, if I continue to manage my progress daily, I could reach it by late Summer Quarter 2026 or early Autumn Quarter 2026.\nPlanning out this far is a bit precarious as I don’t know what I don’t know, so along with the big steps, I am building a list of questions that will help me refine the goals and the steps to achieve them.\n\n\n\n2025-10-19 — Sundays are for Reading\n\nI spent my time today searching for papers re: mussel genomes and the role of DNA methylation. I used Web of Science and Google Scholar to find foundational knowledge papers to help me clarify my understanding of the resources, current knowledge, and future directions with mussels.\n\n\n\n2025-10-20 — Lab Meeting, Goal Setting & FISH 510 Prep\n\nToday’s work was dominantly task- centered instead of deeper work.\n\nI worked on my presentation for FISH 510\nI attended lab meeting where I met 2 of my 4 goals completely and the remaining 2 at approximately 60% each. My goals for the next meeting are to complete the written pieces from my last goal round, and gain clarity in the DNA Methylation analysis so I can plan my next steps\n\n\n\n\n2025-10-21 — Class\n\nTuesday’s are class and RUA days, so my only science work today was attending class and presenting.\n\n\n\n2025-10-22 — Mussel Genomes do What?!?!?\n\nMuch reading and writing today focused on getting through the papers I gathered over the weekend. Interestingly, I just learned that mussels inherit mtDNA from maternal and paternal lines…\n\nI also put my agenda together for my 1v1 with Steven tomorrow. This is the earliest I’ve done it and so close to the 24hr mark that maybe I will make it next week!\n\n\n\n\n2025-10-23 — Lit Pull & Reading\n\nToday was spent working on gathering some baseline data on mytilus trossulus genome, general mytilus species’ genomes, and working through some of my knowledge gaps about mussels.\nWhen meeting with Steven, we talked through my agenda and most recent lit findings, what my next steps should be for building my proposal and a few steps to get started on the methylation dataset.\nI finished the day by applying for the Climate Wayfinders program, which is a fellowship program for early career researchers interested in climate change research, education and science communication.\n\n\n\n2025-10-24 — Epigenetics\n\nI spent some time cleaning up the mussel methylation repo and taking a few steps to understand the bioinformatics workflow, programs and expected outcomes\nI read three of the four papers for next week’s FISH class.\nI built my analysis progress notes in my methylation in Notion, noted what needs to be expanded or further explained, linked my literature from Zotero, and built the script for the initial data pull, reference pull, and multiQC steps.\n\n\n\n2025-10-25 — No Science Today\n\n\n2025-10-26 — No Science Today\n\n\n2025-10-27 — Presentations & Reading\n\nI spent today working on my presentation on 11/3 to Alison’s Ecotox class.\nI continued to move through my pulled papers re: mussel genome information.\nI finished reading the last paper for FISH 510 tomorrow.\n\n\n\n2025-10-28 — Class & Computers\n\nToday’s biggest win was getting my conda/ mamba environment set up on my local machine so that I could work with the bioinformatics tools before jumping over to Raven to work with the methylation data.\n\n\n\n2025-10-29 — Methylation Analysis\n\nI pulled down 2 samples’ sequences, the reference genome and ran the workflow through multiQC, made a list of questions I had about the results and parameters, and started Bismark.\n\n\n\n2025-10-30 — Experimental Design\n\nI spent a lovely morning meeting with Ariana to map out the mussel experiment for my 3rd dissertation chapter. We discussed the experimental design, including the number of replicates, treatment levels, and response variables to measure. We also talked about potential challenges and how to address them.\nI continued the methylation analysis by getting one sample completely through Bismark, but the second one didn’t finish so I will have to troubleshoot that tomorrow.\n\n\n\n2025-10-31 — Experimental Design, Part 2\n\nToday was all about working through the design, listing questions and needs, finding supporting literature, and drafting a schedule for the work."

    "text": "Today has been a heavy re-organization day. While most of what I needed to accomplish was not science related, rebuilding my science timelines and deliverables played a huge role in scheduling out the remainder of Autumn Quarter, assessing my goals, and building timelines that are attainable for my goals for the academic year; building in rest and off-days is also on the ‘must do’ list. While I may not reach candidacy at the close of Spring Quarter 2026, if I continue to manage my progress daily, I could reach it by late Summer Quarter 2026 or early Autumn Quarter 2026.\nPlanning out this far is a bit precarious as I don’t know what I don’t know, so along with the big steps, I am building a list of questions that will help me refine the goals and the steps to achieve them."

    "text": "Today’s mission was to get the ‘simple’ version of the methylation work up and running on Raven. Last week, I built my bioinformatics environment on my local computer so that I could run the initial QC, trimming and alignment on 1-2 sequences so I could understand what I was doing.\n\nI was able to take the code from Steven’s Mytilus Project repo, strip it down to the barest of essentials (so I could understand it) and run through the Bismark alignment. I was able to do this with one sample (read 1 and 2), but my computer didn’t have enough storage/ memory to do the second. Looking at the QC reports, I understand what I see, but I do not understand the Bismark output. This will be a topic in our 1v1 this week.\n\nI finally got my repo up on Raven, cleared the cache on my GH Desktop app so that I could actually work with the remote repo, and made script adjustments so that I could call the programs like FastQC, MultiQC, Bismark and Bowtie outside of my locally- created container.\n\nFirst - and possibly most important, if you update your gitignore file after the first commit without clearing the cache of your GH Desktop app, you will commit/ push files that are listed in the gitignore resulting in a never ending compressing/ writing/ failing loop that will prevent you from doing anything. Thank you StackOverflow for the fix.\nSecond - I will 100% have to move up from Raven to Klone for this work and beyond. Just running the QC work on Raven has taken hours - will most likely take overnight for the process to finish. Not feeling great about it, but it is a tool that must be used."

I am a bit disappointed, but it is how it goes. I will get through the trimming and start the QC again tonight to hopefully have some results in the morning.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that there are a ton of sequences that look like maybe they are from the sequencer, possibly the absolutely raw data instead of the ‘processed raw’ data that is named in alignment with what I named the samples. I will ask about it when I talk to Steven tomorrow.\nI opened a second terminal window to get the trim and QC rolling while the multiQC runs on the fastqc reports.\nI moved the additional sequences from the raw directory to the raw_other directory to hopefully speed up this part of the process."

We see it in everything living from Homo sapiens to Haliotis spp.. Let’s break it down — how marine organisms use it to survive changing oceans, and why, if you can follow a game plan, a scoring drive, or a defensive breakdown, you can absolutely follow the world of epigenetic science."

We’re going to focus on marine invertebrates, but if you want to know more, check out the Coach’s Challenges for where you can find more information.\n\nCoach’s Challenge: Plasticity is pretty cool — it lets organisms withstand environmental change by quickly shifting how they respond, just like calling an audible on the field.

That’s DNA methylation: chemical tags (a.k.a. methyl groups) get added to DNA like a defensive scheme, dictating whether genes are expressed or not.\nOysters, mussels, and corals have used methylation to withstand environmental changes and alter their energy allocation during stressful events. It’s strict, strategic, and controlled. Most mammals have a ton of methylation in their genome—upwards of 70%—because we’re complex and biologically fussy, but marine invertebrates (like oysters, mussels, and corals) are just trying to meet the big basic biological goals: survive long enough to reproduce before you die.

Remodeling physically shifts entire DNA regions by putting them in either zone or stacked play (spaced out or bunched together). Marine species use this when facing extreme stress, like heat waves; they restructure their genome’s landscape the way Geno restructures an offense.\n\nCoach’s Challenge: Histone modification is often linked to chromatin remodeling, but they are not the same — generally, histone modification is a chemical process and chromatin remodeling is a physical process."

Below is your sideline crew.\n::: playbook-card coach-clipboard #### The Epigenetics Staff\n\nDNA methylation: the defensive coordinator\n\nHistone modifications: the footwork and spacing coach\n\nChromatin remodeling: the systems strategist\n\nNon-coding RNAs: the utility players and pit crew\n:::\n\n\nDNA Methylation — The Defensive Coordinator (Nick Saban Energy)\nDNA methylation adds chemical tags (methyl groups) to DNA, often shutting down genes or dialing them back.\nThink Nick Saban:\n\nstrict discipline\n\nshutting down unnecessary plays\n\nkeeping everything controlled and efficient\n\nMarine organisms use methylation to conserve energy and stabilize their internal game plan when conditions get rough.\n\n\nHistone Modifications — Diana Taurasi Footwork & Spacing\nHistones are proteins that DNA wraps around. Modify them, and you tighten or loosen that wrap.\nThat’s Diana Taurasi on defense and offense:\n\na pivot, a hesitation, a shift in angle\n\nsuddenly, the lane is wide open—or totally closed\n\nHistone modifications do the same thing for genes, making certain regions of DNA more or less accessible at exactly the right time.\n\n\nChromatin Remodeling — Geno Auriemma System Vision\nChromatin remodeling complexes move and restructure large segments of DNA, changing what’s exposed and what’s buried.\nThat’s Geno Auriemma:\n\nnot just swapping one play\n\nrethinking the whole offense\n\nputting players (genes) in positions where they can actually shine\n\nWhen marine organisms hit big stress—heat, low oxygen, acidification—chromatin remodeling lets them restructure their molecular strategy on the fly.\n\n\nNon-coding RNAs — Utility Players (A’ja Wilson, Ray Lewis, Ovechkin)\nNon-coding RNAs don’t code for proteins, but they regulate everything:\n\nturning genes on or off\n\namplifying signals\n\nintercepting harmful or useless messages\n\nThey’re A’ja Wilson, Ray Lewis, Alex Ovechkin–type forces: everywhere at once, doing the gritty, unglamorous work that changes the outcome of the game.\n\n##️ Training Camp: What Makes Epigenetics Happen?\nEnvironmental stress is the athlete’s training load.\nMarine organisms can’t switch arenas. Their “training camp” is the real world:\n::: playbook-card condition-check #### Environmental Condition Check\n\nHeat waves → protein stress, altered methylation\n\nHypoxia (low oxygen) → metabolic reprogramming\n\nOcean acidification → changes in shell-building, stress signaling\n\nPollution & contaminants → detox pathways, DNA repair, oxidative stress\n\nSalinity swings & storms → osmotic stress, immune responses\n:::\n\nJust like:\n\naltitude training (hypoxia)\n\nheat training (tennis, track, basketball)\n\ndifferent track or ice conditions (sprinters, skaters, hockey)\n\n…these stressors demand physiological adjustment. Epigenetic marks are the molecular record of that training—temporary or longer-lasting tags that help an organism respond more effectively when conditions shift again."

    "section": "Blog Reflection",
    "text": "Blog Reflection\n\nAudience, Framing, and Scientific Accuracy\nThe primary goal of this communication project was to make the complexity of marine epigenetics accessible, engaging, and relatable to a non-expert audience. My intended audience includes community members, students, science-curious readers, and anyone who may not have a formal background in molecular biology but can follow sports narratives, metaphors, and archetypes.\nBecause marine epigenetics involves dynamic regulatory processes that are challenging to visualize, one of the central decisions I made was to anchor the piece in cultural references that many readers understand; sports, athletes, coaching styles, game strategies, and player analogies. These provide a familiar cognitive framework for readers to map onto the scientific mechanisms. I chose sports specifically because they reflect systems-level coordination: teams, roles, strategies, adjustments, long-term development, and rapid response. These elements align naturally with epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA regulation.\nInstead of overwhelming readers with terminology, the metaphors allow them to conceptualize these mechanisms as coaches, players, and scheme adjustments within a game. Sports also carry emotional resonance, making scientific concepts more memorable without diluting accuracy. Framing the narrative with my personal sports identity served two purposes. First, it grounded the post authentically in my voice. A personal anchor can strengthen public-facing science communication by establishing trust and relatability. Second, it created a throughline that “epigenetics is my Super Bowl” not just as a joke, but as a statement about how meaningful and exciting this field is to me. Enthusiasm can be infectious, especially when introducing complex scientific ideas.\nIn terms of scientific accuracy, I intentionally maintained clarity around what epigenetics is and what it is not. Every metaphor was paired with a scientifically correct description: DNA methylation truly adds methyl groups to cytosines and typically reduces transcription; histone modifications genuinely change the accessibility of DNA wrapped around histone proteins; non-coding RNAs do in fact regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally; chromatin remodeling complexes physically reposition DNA in three-dimensional space. The sports metaphors were used to scaffold, not substitute, scientific detail. I was careful not to conflate acclimatization and adaptation, a common misconception in public discussions of environmental change. The blog post briefly touches on reversible, within-lifetime epigenetic adjustments (acclimatization) from longer-term, cross-generational changes that could contribute to adaptation. Scientific accuracy also guided my description of tools and methods used in marine epigenetics. Rather than implying that researchers “guess” at epigenetic states, I named the actual technologies and explained their relevance. Ultimately, while topical, there are a few places (Coach’s Challenges) where additional, higher- level information can be found. The inclusion of peer review and statistical rigor further reinforced scientific trustworthiness without derailing the storytelling.\nFinally, I wanted the post to end with a sense of momentum. Epigenetics is a rapidly evolving field, and framing future research directions as the rise of “expansion teams” and “rookie superstars” delivered a sense of growth and possibility. Ultimately, my goal was to create an engaging piece that communicates core concepts of marine epigenetics while honoring the complexity of the science. The sports theme provided the right balance of accessibility and creativity, and the final piece reflects a deliberate effort to maintain accuracy while reaching a broad public audience."

    "text": "Course Reflection\n\nLearning, Research and Feedback\nOver the past quarter, this course has deepened my understanding of the many physiological, ecological, and mechanistic processes that underlie aquatic organism function — especially for bivalves — and really put into context just how much remains to be discovered. Through our readings and discussions, I developed a much richer perspective of the multiple epigenetic mechanisms at work as well as the many ways environmental factors modulate those mechanisms. I came away with a clearer sense of not only how these mechanisms operate, but why even small differences among species or environmental context can lead to very different ecological outcomes.\nMuch of my current and future projects already involve contaminants and fundamental physiology — but the conceptual scaffolding that this course provided gives me a clearer lens to add and interpret our findings in a physiological context through epigenetic analysis. Ultimately, the course’s emphasis on mechanisms gives me conceptual tools to better integrate physiology, ecology, and contaminant dynamics — strengthening the ecological relevance and interpretability of my data.\nRegarding course feedback, more notice on final course requirements and greater clarity on how many discussion questions are expected per class. I would have enjoyed participating a bit more in the personal research or ‘cool findings’ posts if I was clearer on the expectation. Moreover, while we read many papers, there was often little time for discussion. Given the complexity of the mechanisms we studied, I think the course would benefit from dedicating some class sessions to student-led discussions or presentations. For example, allowing a student to present one paper aligned with the week’s themes, followed by group discussion, might deepen engagement and understanding more than simply reading multiple articles on one’s own outside of class.\nIn sum, the course enhanced my appreciation for the subtlety and complexity of epigenetic mechanisms. That deeper understanding has already started paying dividends in my research, helping me frame more nuanced hypotheses. With more transparent course structure and more opportunities for discussion or student-led synthesis, I believe the course could become even more effective."

Everything is urgent until something truly urgent comes along.\nNovember goals\n\nFinish biomarker manuscript draft\nFinish MS thesis proposal\nFinish mussel methylation analysis\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-02 — From Kenya to Tacoma and Back\n\nToday’s work was\n\nFinalizing my presentation on the biomarker work for Alison’s class tomorrow.\nCreating the sediment sampling protocol, metadata collection steps, building the data tables and providing open- source resources to gather the data for the NMK team. They go out to our Lake Victoria field sites next week.\nReading papers to help me clarify the experimental design for my chapter 3.\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-03 — Biomarkers\n\nI ran through my ecotox presentation and headed down to Tacoma to give it!\nI met with Alison to discuss transitioning from chapter 2 outcomes to chapter 3 validation and that was super helpful. Our current lab- based plan doesn’t achieve what we are looking for, so I’ll do some more reading and work through some alternatives before meeting with Steven.\nI lectured on biomarkers, conservation, Puget Sound organizations and what it means to be a non-traditional student. It was awesome and I enjoyed getting to practice talking about the biomarker and preliminary DNA methylation work.\n\n\n\n2025-11-04 — No Science Today\n\nNo science work done today.\n\n\n\n2025-11-05 — ENVIR Lecture\n\nI knocked out my Research as Resistance lecture for Friday’s ENV 100 class. I’m definitely nervous about speaking in front of more than 300 students, but if I don’t practice now, I’ll never get used to it.\n\n\n\n2025-11-06 — Writing\n\nI spent the majority of today making an annotated bibliography for the biomarker paper while struggling through writing the introduction. It is still crap, but at least something is on the page.\n\n\n\n2025-11-07 — King Tides\n\nI presented to the ENV 100 class and it was very cool! It is very fun to chat through what I am doing and where I want to go with my work.\nAfter class I got home, packed my gear in the car and headed out to the coast for the weekend so I could take pictures of the tides, read without interruption, and write.\n\n\n\n2025-11-08 — Tides in Tokeland\n\nI spent the majority of the day photographing the coast, the tides, intertidal critters at night, and the towns of Westport and Tokeland.\n\n\n\n2025-11-09 — Tides, Again\n\nI caught the last of the king tides at the Ocean Shores N jetty before heading home and setting up for the week.\n\n\n\n2025-11-10 — No Science Today\n\nNo science today, tons of personal errands and tasks to knock out.\n\n\n\n2025-11-11 — Methylation Analysis\n\nToday’s mission was to get the ‘simple’ version of the methylation work up and running on Raven. Last week, I built my bioinformatics environment on my local computer so that I could run the initial QC, trimming and alignment on 1-2 sequences so I could understand what I was doing.\n\nI was able to take the code from Steven’s Mytilus Project repo, strip it down to the barest of essentials (so I could understand it) and run through the Bismark alignment. I was able to do this with one sample (read 1 and 2), but my computer didn’t have enough storage/ memory to do the second. Looking at the QC reports, I understand what I see, but I do not understand the Bismark output. This will be a topic in our 1v1 this week.\n\nI finally got my repo up on Raven, cleared the cache on my GH Desktop app so that I could actually work with the remote repo, and made script adjustments so that I could call the programs like FastQC, MultiQC, Bismark and Bowtie outside of my locally- created container.\n\nFirst - and possibly most important, if you update your gitignore file after the first commit without clearing the cache of your GH Desktop app, you will commit/ push files that are listed in the gitignore resulting in a never ending compressing/ writing/ failing loop that will prevent you from doing anything. Thank you StackOverflow for the fix.\nSecond - I will 100% have to move up from Raven to Klone for this work and beyond. Just running the QC work on Raven has taken hours - will most likely take overnight for the process to finish. Not feeling great about it, but it is a tool that must be used.\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-12 — More Methylation\n\nStarted today’s work by checking on the status of my QC work I left running last night. It is still running and I anticipate the trimming and QC will take equally as long, so I will use the Bismark output from my local single sample run to touch base with Steven in our 1v1 tomorrow.\nWhile I keep checking in on these things, I am wrapping the introduction for my MS thesis proposal.\nReturning to the methylation analysis, it has taken far longer to get through the QC steps before trimming and repeating the QC and I am going to have to just keep at it to get through it. I am a bit disappointed, but it is how it goes. I will get through the trimming and start the QC again tonight to hopefully have some results in the morning.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that there are a ton of sequences that look like maybe they are from the sequencer, possibly the absolutely raw data instead of the ‘processed raw’ data that is named in alignment with what I named the samples. I will ask about it when I talk to Steven tomorrow.\nI opened a second terminal window to get the trim and QC rolling while the multiQC runs on the fastqc reports.\nI moved the additional sequences from the raw directory to the raw_other directory to hopefully speed up this part of the process.\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-13 — Advisor Check-Ins and Writing\n\nI met with Steven today to go over my current steps in the methylation analysis, clarify the lab based experiment for my dissertation chapters and review the past two weeks of work.\nI worked on changing the second chapter of my MS proposal from eDNA to DNA methylation.\n\n\n\n2025-11-14 — Writing\n\nToday was a writing day. I have toggled between personal writing and proposal writing throughout the day; this helps me refocus when I feel like I am dragging.\nOne major thing I will need to adjust moving forward is my literature review setup. I built a database in Notion that hold all of my papers, annotations, and purpose for the papers, but most of the papers I read and worked on before doing that in September don’t align with the new system and I cannot afford to go back and redo things at this moment… but I will need to make an adjustment so that when my MS proposal is finished, I don’t run into this again.\n\nI also need to ensure the current setup is effective for me since I feel like I spend more time aligning my notes with the system rather than using the system to help me manage my notes.\nOne thing that helps that doesn’t exist yet is a place to keep an annotated bibliography by project - this will help me move quicker though the literature.\nAnother thing is to use a category versus tagging system as the tags are out of hand. My Notion + Zotero integration already imports the keywords from the papers as tags, having my own ‘tags’ group is just making a confusing mess,\nFinally, I need a better way to see my notes in my properties - more aligned with how I take the notes, that make it easier to read without having to click through a million things.\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-15 — No Science Today\n\nNo science today\n\n\n\n2025-11-16 — No Science Today\n\nNo science today\n\n\n\n2025-11-17 — No Science Today\n\nNo science today\n\n\n\n2025-11-18 — FISH 510 & Methylation Analysis\n\nToday is a slow working day after some other responsibilities took me away from my work the last few days.\nI started with adjusting my code like Steven and I discussed so I could reduce the time to run Bismark on the sequences to understand the output and optimize the parameters so that I’m balancing mapping efficiency while monitoring some of the cytosine parameters to ensure no artificial inflation of methylation ID.\nI also started to catch up on my FISH 510 discussion posts by working backwards from the most recent one due to the posts that are overdue.\nFinally, I attended class and participated in the polar bear epigenetic clock conversation.\n\n\n\n2025-11-19 — Wednesdays are for Writing\n\nI realized today that my MS proposal format is wrong. I am actually doing more than needed. During a writing block with KPJ, we realized I was framing the chapters individually rather than weaving together the common goal of both. This means I have been writing too much detail for each chapter rather than focusing on the overall narrative. I need to reframe my proposal to highlight the connections between chapters and how they contribute to my research question. This is relieving.\n\n\n\n2025-11-20 — FISH 510 Coursework\n\nToday’s work was dominantly task- centered as I am a bit behind.\n\nI first knocked out the discussion post for next week’s class. That led me to do a bit of a deeper dive to understand how Botryllus is able to invade, survive and possibly thrive under challenging climate conditions; dominantly the asexually reproducing ones since the paper called out using both asexual and sexually reproductive colonies to interrogate genomic and epigenomic contributions to survival.\nI outlined my final deliverables and chose to go with the blog post. This was fun because translating complex scientific topics to a general audience made me map out what folks need to know to understand the topic, what I knew, and creating a fun roadmap to discuss epigenetics.\n\nI am continuing the methylation analysis, but there have been many stalls and lags with Raven today. Slow and steady…\n\n\n\n2025-11-21 — Writing\n\nI started the day by trying to streamline the lab- based experiment that should be conducted in the winter. It is a bit larger and more involved right now than I think it needs to be.\nI moved next to updating my daily lab notebook entries for the week, I didn’t realize I was this far behind.\nFinally, I finished the introduction to my MS proposal. I have got to get it to Steven for editing before passing off to my committee. I need to have it uploaded and confirmed by my committee by 12/12/25 and this is far tighter a window than I anticipated providing for edits and feedback.\n\n\n\n2025-11-22 — Mussels & Epigenetics\n\nI jumped back into Raven to get my alignments going again- my connection timed out two days ago and I have finally finished cleaning out the pieces of files, fixing my script to find the executable version of Bowtie and set it off and running.\nI outlined my blog post for FISH 510, drafted my reflection statement and set up the plan for the presentation for class on 12/2.\n\n\n\n2025-11-23 — Sundays are for Reading\n\nI spent today reading about the history of Puget Sound waterway accesses and industrialization. Mostly historical non-fiction, not scientific articles.\n\n\n\n2025-11-24 — MS Writing\n\nI finally finished the draft of my MS proposal and got it over to Steven. I have lost the doc I started with my annotated bibliography - before I switched over to Notion, so I will have to go back and tighten up my sources before submitting the draft to my committee.\n\n\n\n2025-11-25 — FISH 510\n\nTuesdays are for RUA, so the only ‘science’ I did today was prepare for and participate in class.\n\n\n\n2025-11-26 — FISH Blog\n\nI completed the draft of my blog for class and my reflection statement… Now on to prep for Thanksgiving tomorrow.\n\n\n\n2025-11-27 — Thanksgiving\n\nThe only science being done today was of the culinary fashion…\n\n\n\n2025-11-28 — No Science\n\nNo science today\n\n\n\n2025-11-29 — Mentoring & Recommendations\n\nI completed three recommendation letters for three former mentees, and one reference for a job for a fourth. These young adults are keeping me busy!\n\n\n\n2025-11-30 — Citing for MS Proposal\n\nI cannot find my annotated bibliography, so I had to comb back through all of my sources to match with what I wrote based on the first- pass notes in Zotero… 0/10 do not recommend.\nI built in the annotated bib section into my Notion literature review database so that as I’m redoing the work, I won’t lose it again."

    "text": "View original daily\n\nToday’s mission was to get the ‘simple’ version of the methylation work up and running on Raven. Last week, I built my bioinformatics environment on my local computer so that I could run the initial QC, trimming and alignment on 1-2 sequences so I could understand what I was doing.\n\nI was able to take the code from Steven’s Mytilus Project repo, strip it down to the barest of essentials (so I could understand it) and run through the Bismark alignment. I was able to do this with one sample (read 1 and 2), but my computer didn’t have enough storage/ memory to do the second. Looking at the QC reports, I understand what I see, but I do not understand the Bismark output. This will be a topic in our 1v1 this week.\n\nI finally got my repo up on Raven, cleared the cache on my GH Desktop app so that I could actually work with the remote repo, and made script adjustments so that I could call the programs like FastQC, MultiQC, Bismark and Bowtie outside of my locally- created container.\n\nFirst - and possibly most important, if you update your gitignore file after the first commit without clearing the cache of your GH Desktop app, you will commit/ push files that are listed in the gitignore resulting in a never ending compressing/ writing/ failing loop that will prevent you from doing anything. Thank you StackOverflow for the fix.\nSecond - I will 100% have to move up from Raven to Klone for this work and beyond. Just running the QC work on Raven has taken hours - will most likely take overnight for the process to finish. Not feeling great about it, but it is a tool that must be used."

I am a bit disappointed, but it is how it goes. I will get through the trimming and start the QC again tonight to hopefully have some results in the morning.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that there are a ton of sequences that look like maybe they are from the sequencer, possibly the absolutely raw data instead of the ‘processed raw’ data that is named in alignment with what I named the samples. I will ask about it when I talk to Steven tomorrow.\nI opened a second terminal window to get the trim and QC rolling while the multiQC runs on the fastqc reports.\nI moved the additional sequences from the raw directory to the raw_other directory to hopefully speed up this part of the process."

    "text": "Following the established protocols of the Resazurin Assay (Huffmyer et al., 2025), I modified the assay to support a trial run for Mytilus trossulus. This work had two goals:\n\n\nFirst, test the metabolic response of mussels held for 30 days in progressively increased water temperatures.\n\n\nSecond, assess the efficacy of the standing protocol for my next mussel experiment, particularly since mussels are less robust than oysters in several ways.\n\n\n\nEstablished Protocol Adjustments\n\nMost of the mussels were on the larger side of the ‘large’ classification outlined in the protocol, so I measured using ImageJ as outlined, and used calipers to measure length, width, and height (in mm) to also proxy volume.\nThe seawater used for the working solution was at a salinity of 27 psu, aligned with the target for the 30-day experiment. This is an adjustment for record- keeping rather than to the protocol itself.\nI purposefully selected mussels as follows:\n\nThe heat treated mussels were similar in size, so one of the control treatment groups were specifically chosen to match size\nOne exceptionally large mussel was chosen to see if size had an effect on the assay results\nAll mussels used in a ‘seawater-only’ control for the assay were as identical in size as possible.\n\nI loaded a plate in triplicate for all values based on unclear expectations for the activity. In addition to that, the following changes to the plate load were:\n\nTwo full rows of resazurin-only wells to ensure there was an accurate “blank” or control value to subtract background fluorescence from.\nTwo full rows of seawater-only wells to verify any measured fluorescence from the seawater itself was negligible.\n\n\n\n\nSetup\nBefore complete take- down of the 30- day survival experiment, mussels were collected (as seen below) and held in their respective tank water before being measured, photographed, and put into their assigned individual containers. A total of 12 mussels were assessed; the two remaining from the elevated temperature treatment and ten from the control temperature.\n\n\n\nMussels were measured two ways: first using calipers to measure width, height, and length, and second, was using ImageJ software. Mussels ranged in length from 46 mm to 96 mm with a median length of\nTotal working solution volume was determined using three ways: first, using caliper measurements as a proxy for volume (length x width x height) and converted to cm3 and summed for total mL; second, using the area measurement tool in ImageJ and converting the same as the first method; and finally, mechanical adding of water to a cup until the mussel was completely submerged, and then measuring that volume using a graduated cylinder. The first and third methods were closely aligned, the second was below required volume. I believe this was because I didn’t also measure width in ImageJ- this will be revisited post- analysis as a check for future experiments.\n\nMussels were in their treatment solution at room temperature (20° C) for approximately 35 minutes before being placed in the cold room for T1 and T2 sampling.\n\nMoving through the experiment, there was not much notable color change in the well plates (as seen in the plate image below). This could indicate a longer testing period, or that room- temperature incubation wasn’t as effective as using the incubator.\n\nSince this was the first time Resazurin was used with mussels in the lab, I ran all samples in triplicate to see if there were any significant deviations in activity. There was some deviation, but two of the three measurements per time cycle were identical or near- identical, so I felt confident in the readings and will run samples in a single- load versus a duplicate or triplicate in future work.\nFinally, the plates at T5 are below, as is a representative image of the color change observed in the sample cups.\n\n\n\n\n\nTL; DR - Experiment Stats\n\n12 total samples assessed across four 96-well plates. Each plate contained the following configuration:\n\n4 mussels in Resazurin (Rows A-D)\n2 mussels in seawater- only, no Resazurin (Rows E-F)\n2 Resazurin- only ‘blanks’, no mussels (Rows G-H)\nAll samples loaded 180 µL in triplicate, this required four total plates\n\nTotal experiment time (including setup and cleanup) was from 1120 - 1834\n\nMussels ranged in length from 46 mm to 96 mm with a median size of 54 mm\nTotal working solution (850 mL) was calculated based on the following volumes:\n\n9 of 12 mussels required ~50 mL solution for submersion\n1 of 12 mussels required 300 mL solution for submersion\n2 of 12 mussels required 0 mL solution since they were seawater- only controls\n2 of 2 Resazurin-only controls (no mussels) required 10 mL solution\n10% additional solution (~150 mL) for slightly larger mussels and in case of mistakes/ re-run potential\n\nMetabolic activity assessed from 1255 - 1757\nT0 measured at 1255, T1 - T4 measured at hour intervals with the final T5 measurement at 1757\n2 mussels from the increased temperature treatment (22° C)\n\n1 of 2 mussels didn’t survive (mortality at T3)\n1 of 2 mussels survived for the duration of the experiment\n\n10 mussels from the control temperature (11° C)\n\n10 out of 10 mussels survived for the duration of the experiment\n\n\nNoticeable color change didn’t occur in most samples despite increasing activity values from the plate reader\nDuration of experiment may not have reached an activity plateau indicating the need for longer experimental duration, increased incubation temperatures, or a combination to properly stress the organisms into increased or ‘maintained’ metabolic stress response.\nNext steps: clone the training repo and run the analysis and visualization scripts."

My blog is coming together pretty nicely, so we shall see.\n\n\n\n2025-12-02 — RUA Day, No Science Today\n\nNo science today.\n\n\n\n2025-12-03 — Reading & Writing\n\nAll things mussels. Literature, textbooks, brain dump drafting…\n\n\n\n2025-12-04 — Drafting a Mussel Survivability Experiment\n\nI put together a loose plan to test the thermal thresholds and survivability of mussels in a lab- based experiment for at least 30 days.\n\nWhile intertidal/ nearshore habitats get super hot, super quick in the summer, that is not the case in the winter so the temperature thresholds are lower.\nA 30-day experiment will have two temperature treatments: a control temp (between 8° C - 12° C), and an elevated temp as high as we can push until we hit 50% mortality (between 20° C - 26° C)\n\n\n\n\n2025-12-05 — Science Hour and Mussel Experiments\n\nI jumped into science hour to chat with Steven about getting the pilot mussel experiment up and running. Clarified some logistics and I will be ready to get it started on Monday.\n\n\n\n2025-12-06 — No Science Today\n\nNo science work done today.\n\n\n\n2025-12-07 — Reading\n\nI spent a good chunk of time reading through the applicable chapters of Applied Environmental Genomics thinking about methods and techniques that are transferable to ecotox work.\nThe remainder of the time was spent reading and annotating the 2022 updated text on Marine Mussels from Gosling. I want to be crystal clear on mussel physiology and ecology before I start executing the full experiment.\n\n\n\n2025-12-08 — Mussels in the Cold Room\n\nToday is the day to begin to test the tolerance of mussels to lab life.\n\nI picked up 1.5 pounds of mussels from QFC in the morning. The counter clerk said they came in directly from Penn Cove. He quickly sorted to remove the obviously dead mussels, and also checked to see if there was any information on the shipping paperwork about how long they were there. There was nothing he could find.\nI used a cooler in the cold room, to set up with air stones and filled with ‘seawater’ using freshwater and Instant Ocean. All mussels were again sorted and bagged, discarding the dead ones. There were 68 total mussels separated into 4 mesh bags.\nThe mussels were held in the cold room at 11° C, salinity of 25 psu, and not fed.\n\n\n\n\n2025-12-09 — Mussel Check\n\nMussel check at 0700. The cooler is a bit cloudy, but there seems to be no obvious mortalities.\n\n\n\n2025-12-10 — Mussel Check\n\nPrior to my arrival on campus, the mussels were removed from the cooler as they were all dead.\n\nThe thought is that they were at reduced capacity as they were in the grocery store out of water for too long to be effective for this trial.\nNext steps are to reach out to Penn Cove directly to pick up some fresh mussels for another crack at it.\n\n\n\n\n2025-12-11 — No Science Today\n\nNo science today.\n\n\n\n2025-12-12 — Lost Notebooks\n\nToday I realized all of my early notes on the papers for the biomarker manuscript are missing. I have the notes once I shifted to my Notion/ Zotero digital setup, but none of the early notes.\n\nI will keep searching, but I will need to go back and skim the papers with missing notes to prioritize them before tackling each of the 60+ papers in the project.\n\n\n\n\n2025-12-13 to 12-21\n\nAn atmospheric river is causing flooding that will not allow the Penn Cove folks harvest until DOH lifts the ban. They have been super helpful and keep me updated on when it will be ok to come up as they know.\nBeyond skimming biomarker papers, checking in with Penn Cove, and working through the broader experimental planning for the second phase of mussel work, the majority of my time has been spent prepping for the holidays.\n\n\n\n2025-12-22 — Bypass Package Work\n\nI spent intentional time mapping out the status and next steps of all of the pieces of the bypass package.\n\nA large part of this was working on how to frame Chapter 3 and 4 so that it wasn’t completely off-base from the plan Steven and I worked on in November, but still aligned.\nThe other major task was to identify which lit had notes, didn’t have notes, and what was important to get the writing out versus what could wait.\n\n\n\n\n2025-12-23 — Mussels are Almost Ready\n\nPenn Cove let me know I could place an order for pickup on 12/24, and I did. Let’s go!\n\n\n\n2025-12-24 — Mussel Pickup and Experiment Setup, Day 1\n\nI ran out to Penn Cove to grab 2lbs of mussels.\nBack at the lab, I set up the tank, performed a visual inspection of the mussels, bagged them and put them in the tank for a week of acclimation to the new environment without food.\n\nFive bags of 15 mussels each - Total of 75 mussels once dead or damaged ones were discarded\nTank water was kept at cold room temp (11° C), Instant Ocean was added to a salinity of 25 psu, mussels were added, and pH was 7.4 approximately 1 hour post placement in the tank.\nThey will remain this way for one week with daily temperature, salinity and mortality checks.\n\n\n\n\n2025-12-25 — Mussel Check\n\nDay 2. Checked at 1530\nVisual tank inspection looked good for airflow and water clarity. The mussels in each bag have started to aggregate into a few clusters by using their byssal threads to attach to each other and the bags.\nTemperature= 11° C\nSalinity= 25 psu\n1 mortality found\n\n\n\n2025-12-26 — Mussel Check\n\nDay 3. Checked at 1007\nVisual tank inspection looked good for airflow and water clarity. Some foaming happening. Mussels still aggregated.\nTemperature= 11° C\nSalinity= 26 psu\nNo mortalities\n\n\n\n2025-12-27 — Mussel Check\n\nDay 4. Checked at 1210\nVisual tank inspection looked good for airflow and water clarity. Foam that looked the same as yesterday. Mussels still aggregated.\nTemperature= 11° C\nSalinity= 26 psu\nNo mortalities\n\n\n\n2025-12-28 — Mussel Check\n\nDay 5. Checked at 1815\nVisual tank inspection looked good for airflow and water clarity. Foam just looks like dirt on the side of the tank; the bottom of the tanks is DIRTY. Mussels still aggregated.\nTemperature= 11° C\nSalinity= 26 psu\nNo mortalities\n\n\n\n2025-12-29 — Mussel Check\n\nDay 6. Checked at 1443\nVisual tank inspection looked good for airflow and water clarity. Tank looked the same as the day before. Mussels still aggregated.\nTemperature= 11° C\nSalinity= 27 psu\nNo mortalities\nSalinity is creeping up, so I drained about half of the water and added fresh seawater after 90 minutes to ensure the water temperatures were the same.\n\nSalinity rechecked post change= 25 psu\n\n\n\n\n2025-12-30 — Mussel Check, Water Change & Temp Increase\n\nDay 7. Checked at 1237\nVisual tank inspection looked ok for airflow and water clarity. Tank water didn’t change much between yesterday and today. Mussels still aggregated.\nTemperature= 11° C\nSalinity= 25 psu\nNo mortalities\nI setup the two coolers for the next step.\n\nThe blue cooler is for the control mussels, 3 of 5 bags will be held at 11° C\nThe red cooler is for the elevated temperature mussels, 2 of 5 bags will be held at 15° C for the next week\nBoth the blue and the red coolers were setup with air and fresh seawater (Instant Ocean/ freshwater mix) to about a 1/3 of the tank capacity. Tank water from the acclimation tank was added to both coolers to prevent any ‘shock’ and bring water levels to about 2/3 of the cooler capacity. This is enough to keep the mussels off the bottom, but still submerged.\nThe red cooler also received a submersible heater with a digital control to maintain the water temperature at 15° C.\nMussels were placed in the new coolers; both blue and red coolers were still at 11° C at the time of transfer.\n\nBlue= temperature at 11° C, salinity at 25 psu\nRed= temperature at 15° C, salinity at 25 psu\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-12-31 — Mussel Check & Feeding\n\nDay 8. Checked at 1338\nVisual tank inspections looked good for airflow and water clarity. Mussels were still aggregated in their respective bags/ coolers. The airflow in blue is a bit lower than in red. Will continue to monitor.\nTemperature\n\nBlue= 11° C\nRed= 15° C\n\nSalinity\n\nBlue= 22 psu\nRed= 25 psu\n\nMortality\n\nBlue= 0\nRed= 0\n\nFeeding.\n\nShellfish Diet 1800, in the glass refrigerator in 213\n\nPer instructions, .03mL/ g of tissue was mixed into a 400 mL slurry with tank water and then added to both tanks slowly. Blue= 250 mL, Red= 150 mL since there are more mussels in Blue. The calculation is below, based on the full 2 pounds since a negligible number of mussels died.\n2 pound of mussels yields between 1/3 - 1/4 of tissue (32 oz yields 9.6 - 12.8 ounces of tissue) from the total weight.\n9.6 - 12.8 ounces equals 272 - 363 grams (1oz= 28.35g). I split the difference and calculated based on 318 grams.\n318g x .03mL= 9.5 mL Shellfish Diet\n\n\nPost feeding, I rechecked the salinity in Blue and added about 1/2 gallon of seawater to bring salinity to 25"
