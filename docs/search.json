    "text": "Progress Makes a PhD\n\nMy Graduate Work in the Roberts’ Lab at the University of Washington\nStraddling the line between classic ecological methods and cutting- edge molecular techniques, I am building my marine science foundation as a Marine Molecular Ecologist studying nearshore ecosystems in Puget Sound and the greater Salish Sea. While my graduate work is dominantly focused on conservation ecology, it can also be readily applied to aquaculture and sustainable food systems. The stars of the show are marine invertebrates, mostly foundational species like mussels, but I also incorporate the exploration of the relationship dynamics between human and non-human kin. Ultimately, I want to understand how human-induced environmental changes influence nearshore communities at different scales from the organismal and ecosystem level."

    "text": "I had the great fortune of collaborating with the University of Minnesota (UMN) and the National Museums of Kenya (KMN) in July and August to conduct field work that supported expanding our limited academic knowledge of Mormyrids, a weakly electric fish with a population in Lake Victoria, Kenya. Under the guidance of PI Kassie Ford, UMN Professor and Bell Museum Curator, we worked in direct collaboration with the ichthyologists at KMN to procure samples of as many species of mormyrids as we could for addition to the KMN fish collection and further projects amongst our respective institutions. My role, as the only non-ichthyologist, was to collect water and sediment samples for eDNA analysis to build a snapshot of the trophic composition of Lake Victoria and it’s estuaries along with collecting stomach contents from multiple species at each site to support the mormyrid diet analysis assesment of MS student Kassi Price.\nWe spent over a month visiting sites around the lake between the Tanzanian and Ugandan border (as well as the rivers that fed into the lake) collecting samples and assessing basic water quality (temperature, pH, salinity, etc), habitat differences, and watching over our shoulders for crocodiles and hippos! Ultimately, we used a variety of techniques and employed the support of local fishermen to expand our limited knowledge and help us reach our sampling goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt every single location we were greeted by people who were interested in our work. Dominantly children, but plenty of adults that helped us gain knowledge about the area, where to find certain fishes, and the best places to avoid conflict with wildlife. It was an incredibly welcoming and enthusiastic environment to work in. Most hilarious was the constant shouts of ‘Mzungu’ when local folks saw us in our vehicle or in the rivers or lake. It loosely means ‘European person’, but as we soon found out it essentially means anyone who is not from Kenya. It was really fun to talk with everyone as they were as interested in us as we were in them - it made long field days that much more enjoyable.\nAs we wrapped up our work and headed back to Nairobi, we parted ways with our KNM collaborators and closed our trip with a 3 day safari in Masai Mara National Park. To say it is as magical as you expect and more is an understatement. I know everyone loves the big cats, but my favorites were the zebras and the wildebeests.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe saw so many animals I had only seen in books or in zoos! Truth be told, the fish were cool, but this was a bucket list, once in a lifetime opportunity that I cannot get over. I am excited to be contributing to the body of knowledge around Lake Victoria by providing a baseline community composition in the dry season; something that doesn’t exist for any season, but I am most proud of the relationships we’re building, the future collaborations to come, and another opportunity to visit Kenya."

    "text": "Started with a re-run of my site comparisons for the biomarkers. I was writing the results and trying to make some sense of what wasn’t sitting right, and it turns out that if you aren’t using the correct df in your code, you get a p-value of 0.478 for every single metric you are looking at when trying to understand if there are differences by site…\nAlison and I met to talk about the paper and how we’re going to get the manuscript ready for the WIMS x ICB submission window time frame. I felt really good about it and I believe she’s cautiously optimistic that we’ll make it!\nI had a wonderful conversation with Chelsea Wood today - scheduled - to discuss how to start curating my science brand and where to focus my professional development so that I’m not trying to slam in all of the work in my final year when I’m trying to apply for positions.\nI ended the day working on pulling lit on the efficacy of conservation ecology work. This proved to be very difficult to find since the dominant result was either about engineering, the role of specific species, or commentary on how conservation practices should work. I made a log of search terms, platforms, results returned and added about 30 papers that get close to my topic, but this is still not working as I wanted.\n\nUltimately, this makes me question how we get the siloed work of individual organizations aligned with the ‘big data’ that is being collected, or how we gain access or clarity around the data and action of the organizations. Trying to clarify the efficacy of conservation efforts is challenging, especially when we all define efficacy a bit different."

I added the tasks to my Notion management setup, separated in quick tasks and anything that will take longer than 30 minutes so I could manage getting a few things done where I can rather than try to knock out big chunks at a time.\n\nMy primary work (deep work) focused on getting back to the biomarker work I set down before leaving for the summer. I reviewed my most recent analysis notes, the questions/ comments I made for myself, and then the analyses. I had a hard time evaluating what was most important to tackle first, so I spent some time listing out my decisions to get to the end analyses and what result mapped to what choice before I could really get my head back in the game. This helped me identify an error in my contaminant indices and note that I needed to re-link the curated literature review to the draft in the methods and discussion drafting."

Is it effective? How do we know?\n\nScoped to historical efficacy, collegiate preparation and inclusion, and new data techniques to bring together all the pertinent information to make decisions.\nLooking through the data and practitioners - not policy even though I will have to address \n\nWhat teaching methods will support the learning and research for the next group of conservationists?\nWhere are the new and the established conservationists aligned or mismatched with current conservation professionals?\n\nSocial expectation - changes in workload versus personal time, work ethic?, compensation, and societal acceptance or celebration of the work\nEducational expectation - what skills are new folks coming in with, is it mismatched to what is needed, how does the UG degree provide (or not) the skills to be successful, and is there commentary on how that has changed over time?\nUrgency - efficacy is the question of the hour as we are losing time to ‘reverse’ or ‘stop’ change. Can we stop it, should we stop it, and how does multiple knowledge systems’ incorporation into the application of the data (and how its gathered) alter or confirm the future of conservation?\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Assumptions\n\nAssessing the nearshore environment from ecosystem level to organismal impact is thorough but incomplete without considering how the human element impacts the ecosystem.\nConservation Ecology is the end focus - what can my work do to bring together/ or bridge the existing data, identify where data is incomplete, or support the folks who want data-driven actions/ solutions to conservation\nWe are not working with micro-plastics. Contamination work is the only axis of alteration we are assessing directly.\n\n\n\nThings to Consider\n\nWhere are the gaps in my approach?\nCan I launch an eDNA bio blitz where WDFW is outplanting the mussels if we find interesting correlations from the biomarker work and the DNA methylation work?\nWhat are the other axes of human impact in conservation ecology that I’m overlooking OR need to address?"

Today’s science focus was on rebuilding, updating and launching my 2025-26 AY lab notebook. Related, I made a ‘sprint’ task list for quick tasks I can do to tighten up my GitHub setup, cleanup my repos, and identify any pinch points for making a daily update. My second focus was to setup weekly meetings with my PI and gather materials for my first meeting on 9.25.25.\n\n\n2025-09-25 — Put Your $$ Where Your Mouth Is\n\nToday’s work fell in the broad category of preparing for lab meeting and the subsequent 1v1 with Steven. My main takeaways are to set explicit goals that we will share and work on in biweekly lab meetings.\n\nMy goal for next lab working session is to have one of my three bypass chapters complete to the standard of the package and the other two fully outlined.\n\nMeeting with Steven post lab meeting we agreed that my AY goal, to become a candidate by the end of the year, is big but doable as long as I stay accountable to myself. Additionally, my deliverable from the meeting is to complete the SAFS milestones form and get it back to him by the end of the week.\n\n\n\n2025-09-26 — Biomarkers, Back Again\n\nMy work today started with a quick audit of my GH repos and what should be cleaned up as I move forward. I added the tasks to my Notion management setup, separated in quick tasks and anything that will take longer than 30 minutes so I could manage getting a few things done where I can rather than try to knock out big chunks at a time.\n\nMy primary work (deep work) focused on getting back to the biomarker work I set down before leaving for the summer. I reviewed my most recent analysis notes, the questions/ comments I made for myself, and then the analyses. I had a hard time evaluating what was most important to tackle first, so I spent some time listing out my decisions to get to the end analyses and what result mapped to what choice before I could really get my head back in the game. This helped me identify an error in my contaminant indices and note that I needed to re-link the curated literature review to the draft in the methods and discussion drafting.\n\n\n\n2025-09-27 — Day Off\nNo science work was done today.\n\n\n2025-09-28 — Biomarkers Literature Reconciliation\n\nAll of today’s focus was in tidying up my notes and citations for the biomarker manuscript draft. I have left notes or comments for myself that are a little cryptic, or worse, tags that aren’t as descriptive as I need. The goal was to ensure I have the right citations in the right places and identify anything that needs additional depth in citations (biomarker work is rich in practitioners) or needs a citation period. This took much longer than I anticipated, so I knocked off for the day after that.\n\n\n\n2025-09-29 — Bypass & Biomarkers\n\nMost of today’s work focused on my science task management.\n\nI completed the overdue milestones in the new SAFS tracker. As soon as my committee signs the Docusigm, I can submit that and get off the ‘bad kids list’.\nI sent out the scheduler for my first committee meeting of the quarter. That meeting will be between 10/7 - 10/17.\nI sent my ‘degree work’ explainer over to Manca. She is helping to connect me to her former colleagues at WWU, so I needed to write a paragraph about my work and ultimate dissertation topic for her to send - that took me a surprisingly long time to craft. That flagged my need to clarify my work in both my mind and in how I share it - part of my personal goals for the year.\nI spent the rest of my science admin time assessing and mapping my deliverables for the bypass package and working to identify where I will need help.\n\nMy biomarker work was in mapping my plots for the manuscript and trying to get some of those plots to look better. Even when plotting by site (74 of them) the plots are a bit crowded, so I was working on that.\n\n\n\n2025-09-30 — It’s Epigenetics, Baby\n\nTuesdays are typically days where minimal science will be done since my student assistance-ship is the dominant player, but for at least one hour every week this quarter I’ll get some science in there!\n\nSteven’s class focused on epigenetics is a literature review class where we learn foundational concepts in the discipline and then bring our own interesting literature to present while interacting with what implications this information could have on our own work.\nToday was the first class, so it was a familiarization, a chance to read a foundational paper, and work test run the GitHub workflow for the course."

    "text": "All science today was in the reading and re-reading of the literature behind the biomarker work. I have a Zotero project with almost 100 papers in it that are at various levels of annotation and note taking. Not ideal.\n\nI updated my sync to Notion by removing the complete project, selecting the papers I knew were 100% going to be cited, and then started triaging the mess I made to date.\nNext, I made a holding folder for papers that may support very specific analysis decisions and papers that will support specific text in the manuscript.\nFinally, I refined my note taking template to make the necessary information visible in a database in Notion so that when I want to review all papers supporting methods or my introduction or whatever, I can just sort and see my notes rather than have to open and close each individual entry to create another document that can get lost."

    "text": "Kicked off today by updating my lab notebook daily entries. I forgot to update my reminder to continue past the previous week, so fixed that as well.\nI organized my 1v1 agenda and got it rendered into a notebook post so Steven knows what we’re chatting about later today.\nMet with my friend and fellow SAFS grad student, Maddie. We set up some co- working blocks, talked through our respective projects and bounced ideas off of each other for improvements, suggestions and overall vibes.\nMet with Julia to discuss managing multiple projects, getting the writing done, and meeting grad milestones met without going insane.\nMet with Steven to go over my framing of my bypass package. He was on-board with the big picture but there is some places where I can more explicitly shore up the expansion. He gave me advice on how to frame that and we wrapped up for the day.\nI spent some time this evening working on the framing of my bypass presentation for my October 9th committee meeting\nWrapped up the day with work on the biomarker analysis. The correlations seem to be far higher in number of significant results than when I previously worked on it, so I needed to investigate. Turns out I created a loop that was correlating the wrong variables. Fixed that."

    "text": "All of today’s focus was in tidying up my notes and citations for the biomarker manuscript draft. I have left notes or comments for myself that are a little cryptic, or worse, tags that aren’t as descriptive as I need. The goal was to ensure I have the right citations in the right places and identify anything that needs additional depth in citations (biomarker work is rich in practitioners) or needs a citation period. This took much longer than I anticipated, so I knocked off for the day after that."

Today’s science focus was on rebuilding, updating and launching my 2025-26 AY lab notebook. Related, I made a ‘sprint’ task list for quick tasks I can do to tighten up my GitHub setup, cleanup my repos, and identify any pinch points for making a daily update. My second focus was to setup weekly meetings with my PI and gather materials for my first meeting on 9.25.25."

    "text": "Attended lab meeting where we shared our bi-weekly goals, progress, knowledge nuggets, and upcoming goals. My responses are below. My goals are built off of my Autumn quarter goals/ plan to meet those goals.\nI worked on my bypass presentation for my committee meeting on Thursday.\n\n\nNotes from 10.06.2025 Lab Meeting\n\nGoals set on 9/25/25: Have one chapter of my PhD proposal drafted and the others outlined.\n\nProgress as of 10/06/25\nAfter dusting off the docs and taking an inventory of where each of the pieces stand, I have the 3 PhD chapters outlined and pivoted to working on my first MS chapter. I chose to shift away from the PhD proposal focus so that I could knock out the MS chapter since it is my required manuscript for the package and needs to be reviewed/ approved by both the committee and WDFW.\n\n\nMy knowledge nuggets all center around things I’m using to maximize my working time and reduce the number of ‘administrative’ tasks I need to do to get rolling on the real work.\n\n\n1st- the Graduate School Funding Guide has a huge database (GFIS) of funding opportunities that you can search, download into a csv and explore on your own time. It also has the college-wide Assistantships database you can explore. There are dedicated support resources through the library if you have questions.\n2nd- If you use Zotero and want to clean up your literature review process, link it to something like Notion or any other organizational platform that supports integration and keep all of your notes and annotations in one place. This video from The Grad School Coach shows you how to integrate Notion & Zotero, and this video from Aynur Science on how to create a literature review workflow using Notion that supports information recall.\n3rd- Wondering where your time is going? I did my own time trials using Toggl this summer to see how long my most frequent tasks (reading and annotating a paper, coding plots, setting up data cleaning scripts, etc.) take me to complete so that I could better schedule my day and not demoralize myself when I’m not meeting my productivity goals. I used daily to track my time, help me build my weekly time blocking schedules, and review where I’m getting lost, and as a bonus, I can see just how much work on each project I am putting in and how to adjust for the upcoming week. Toggl is platform that you can use for free, but there are paid upgrades if you want them. I’ve been using it since July and haven’t needed to upgrade at all, all of the free functions are great.\n\n\nGoals set on 10/06 for completion by 10/20 lab meeting:\n1. Finish the biomarker manuscript 10/9\n2. Finish the committee meeting presentation 10/9\n3. Complete draft of my MS thesis 10/14\n4. Create bench protocol for Kenya samples 10/20"

    "text": "Today’s work fell in the broad category of preparing for lab meeting and the subsequent 1v1 with Steven. My main takeaways are to set explicit goals that we will share and work on in biweekly lab meetings.\n\nMy goal for next lab working session is to have one of my three bypass chapters complete to the standard of the package and the other two fully outlined.\n\nMeeting with Steven post lab meeting we agreed that my AY goal, to become a candidate by the end of the year, is big but doable as long as I stay accountable to myself. Additionally, my deliverable from the meeting is to complete the SAFS milestones form and get it back to him by the end of the week."

    "text": "Most of today’s work focused on my science task management.\n\nI completed the overdue milestones in the new SAFS tracker. As soon as my committee signs the Docusigm, I can submit that and get off the ‘bad kids list’.\nI sent out the scheduler for my first committee meeting of the quarter. That meeting will be between 10/7 - 10/17.\nI sent my ‘degree work’ explainer over to Manca. She is helping to connect me to her former colleagues at WWU, so I needed to write a paragraph about my work and ultimate dissertation topic for her to send - that took me a surprisingly long time to craft. That flagged my need to clarify my work in both my mind and in how I share it - part of my personal goals for the year.\nI spent the rest of my science admin time assessing and mapping my deliverables for the bypass package and working to identify where I will need help.\n\nMy biomarker work was in mapping my plots for the manuscript and trying to get some of those plots to look better. Even when plotting by site (74 of them) the plots are a bit crowded, so I was working on that."

    "text": "My work today started with a quick audit of my GH repos and what should be cleaned up as I move forward. I added the tasks to my Notion management setup, separated in quick tasks and anything that will take longer than 30 minutes so I could manage getting a few things done where I can rather than try to knock out big chunks at a time.\n\nMy primary work (deep work) focused on getting back to the biomarker work I set down before leaving for the summer. I reviewed my most recent analysis notes, the questions/ comments I made for myself, and then the analyses. I had a hard time evaluating what was most important to tackle first, so I spent some time listing out my decisions to get to the end analyses and what result mapped to what choice before I could really get my head back in the game. This helped me identify an error in my contaminant indices and note that I needed to re-link the curated literature review to the draft in the methods and discussion drafting."

I moved pieces into their respective manuscript sections, aligned any citations that related, and tried to pull out the important pieces that keep the doc moving forward without my desire to wax poetic about the whole thing."

I added my deadlines, deliverables and tasks and linked the literature for the course to the full project page.\nSecond, I started answering the Discussion Questions for the week and looking ahead to the upcoming week. The goal is to post responses to the discussion questions for the following week by Thursday of the week we’re in. I missed the mark this week, but it shouldn’t be difficult moving forward.\n\nI worked on wrapping up the biomarker analysis validation and documenting what steps and decisions I made in data manipulation, statistical analysis choices, and my interpretations of the individual results while thinking through what the results mean all together."
