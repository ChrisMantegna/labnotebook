    "text": "Progress Makes a PhD\n\nMy Graduate Work in the Roberts’ Lab at the University of Washington\nStraddling the line between classic ecological methods and cutting- edge molecular techniques, I am building my marine science foundation as a Marine Molecular Ecologist studying nearshore ecosystems in Puget Sound and the greater Salish Sea. While my graduate work is dominantly focused on conservation ecology, it can also be readily applied to aquaculture and sustainable food systems. The stars of the show are marine invertebrates, mostly foundational species like mussels, but I also incorporate the exploration of the relationship dynamics between human and non-human kin. Ultimately, I want to understand how human-induced environmental changes influence nearshore communities at different scales from the organismal and ecosystem level."

Today’s science focus was on rebuilding, updating and launching my 2025-26 AY lab notebook. Related, I made a ‘sprint’ task list for quick tasks I can do to tighten up my GitHub setup, cleanup my repos, and identify any pinch points for making a daily update. My second focus was to setup weekly meetings with my PI and gather materials for my first meeting on 9.25.25."

Additionally, my deliverable from the meeting is to complete the SAFS milestones form and get it back to him by the end of the week."
