While my graduate work is dominantly focused on conservation ecology, it can also be readily applied to aquaculture and sustainable food systems. The stars of the show are marine invertebrates, mostly foundational species like mussels, but I also incorporate the exploration of the relationship dynamics between human and non-human kin. Ultimately, I want to understand how human-induced environmental changes influence nearshore communities at different scales from the organismal and ecosystem level.\n",
