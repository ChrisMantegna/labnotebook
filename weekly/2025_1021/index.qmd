## Overview

-   What happens when environmental exposure leaves a molecular
    “memory”?
-   How do these changes get passed on to offspring?
-   Two focal papers:
    -   *Ancestor’s Gift: Parental Early Exposure to Pesticide Mixture
        Drives Offspring Phenotype*
    -   *Epigenetic Profiling to Environmental Stressors in Model and
        Non-Model Organisms*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hook: Can Experience Be Inherited?

> “If a parent fish is exposed to pesticides, could its grandchildren be
> affected—even if they never encounter those chemicals?”

-   Introduce the concept of **transgenerational epigenetic
    inheritance**\
-   Image: generational diagram (F0 → F1 → F2 → F3)
-   Key idea: *environmental exposures can alter gene expression without
    changing DNA sequence*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What Is Ecotoxicology?

-   **Epigenetics** = heritable, reversible changes in gene expression
-   Main mechanisms:
    -   DNA methylation\
    -   Histone modification\
    -   Noncoding RNAs\
-   These regulate *when, where, and how much* genes are expressed

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Context: Environmental Epigenetics

From *Ehtisham-Ul-Haq et al. (2018)*

-   Environmental factors like toxins, temperature, and diet can
    reprogram the epigenome\
-   Epigenetic markers can serve as **biomarkers of exposure**
-   Key takeaway: \> Environmental stressors leave “molecular
    footprints” that link ecology and physiology

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Knowledge Gap

-   Many studies show epigenetic shifts after exposure\
-   But: How long do these changes last?
-   Do they influence **offspring phenotype**?
-   Can they be inherited across generations?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Case Study: “Ancestor’s Gift”

From *Lange et al. (2023)*

-   **Organism:** \[insert species; e.g., zebrafish or medaka\]
-   **Exposure:** early-life parental exposure to a **realistic
    pesticide mixture**
-   **Goal:** determine whether this alters offspring phenotype and gene
    expression

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods Snapshot

-   Parental (F0) exposure → offspring (F1) analysis
-   Measures included:
    -   Growth and morphology\
    -   Behavior or stress response\
    -   Methylation / gene expression profiling
-   Controlled design mimicking *environmentally relevant
    concentrations*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Findings

-   Offspring from exposed parents showed:
    -   Altered phenotype (e.g., reduced growth or altered behavior)
    -   Epigenetic changes linked to exposure
-   No DNA sequence changes — effects are **epigenetic**
-   Suggests *intergenerational inheritance* of pesticide effects

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Synthesis: Connecting the Two Papers

| Concept | Review Paper | Research Paper |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Mechanisms | DNA methylation, histone mods, ncRNAs | DNA methylation & gene expression |
| Focus | Framework for ecotoxicology | Experimental validation |
| Outcome | Environmental memory | Transgenerational phenotype |

> Epigenetic mechanisms act as the bridge between exposure and
> inheritance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Broader Implications

-   Redefines how we think about **toxicity** and **risk**
-   Epigenetic inheritance adds a **temporal dimension** to
    environmental science
-   Raises ethical and policy questions:
    -   Should chemical testing consider effects in *future
        generations*?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discussion Prompt

> “If epigenetic changes are reversible, at what point do they become
> evolutionarily significant?”

Encourage brief discussion or thought-pair-share with classmates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Interactive Activity Options

### Option 1: Predict the Effect

**Group task (5 min):** - Each group gets a scenario card: 1. Fish
exposed to heavy metals (F0 only) 2. Frogs exposed to pesticides for two
generations 3. Mammals exposed to high temperatures

**Predict:** - Which mechanism (methylation, histone mod, ncRNA)? - What
phenotype might change? - Is it intergenerational or transgenerational?

Groups share 1-min summaries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Option 2: Mechanism Matching Game

**Cards:**\
- Environmental stressors (heat, pesticides, metals)\
- Mechanisms (methylation, acetylation, miRNA)\
- Outcomes (growth change, stress tolerance, reproduction)

Students match stressor → mechanism → outcome.\
Discuss connections to the two focal papers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Option 3: Policy Pitch

**Prompt:** - Design a 1-minute pitch for an environmental monitoring
strategy - How could we test for long-term epigenetic effects? - Should
regulatory frameworks require multi-generational data?

Groups present quick pitches, followed by class vote for “most feasible
idea.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Takeaways

-   Epigenetic mechanisms mediate environmental memory\
-   Pesticide exposure can shape future generations’ phenotypes\
-   Integrating epigenetics into ecotoxicology reframes how we assess
    environmental risk
