Today's Meeting is all about mussel reproduction, environmentally induced sex determinants and whatever is up with maternal and *paternal* mtDNA... cool stuff.

### Here are the questions/ chapters we were kicking around last meeting:

#### The overarching theme is: Exploring xenobiotic effects and consequences in mussels (to mussel physiology)

-   Chapters 1 & 2 (my MS work) remain the biomarker and DNA methylation work, respectively

    -   Can the mussels from the WDFW Nearshore Monitoring Program be used to assess the impact of contaminants on the mussels using traditional biomarkers?

    -   Can epigenetics (DNA Methylation) be used to identify novel biomarkers of PAH exposure in mussels?

-   Chapter 3 is lab testing the results of the Chapter 2

    -   Utilize 'new' mussels to test the outcomes of the mussels that show differential methylation from Chapter 2.

    -   Short- term (1-3 month) and longer term (3-6 month) lab- based exposure and response experiments designed to characterize the metabolic threshold of mussels exposed to known contaminant mixtures that mimic those in Puget Sound.

        -   Clarify stress induced DMLs and their pathways. Do they align with the DMLs in Chapter 2?

-   Chapter 4 is a larger synthesis of the knowledge gained in Chapters 2 and 3.

    -   What are the contaminants inducing in mussels that can have broader population or ecosystem implications?

        -   This can be assessed through a variety of field- based experiments

            -   Outplanting primed and non-primed mussels to assess response at sites with higher or lower contaminant burdens.

            -   Reciprocal outplanting - mussels outplanted at high contaminant sites are moved to sites with low contamination and vice versa.

#### Larger questions we're kicking around to use as guides in creating the initial proposal (in addition to those above)

-   Do epigenetics play a role in creating a phenotypic buffer that supports mussel acclimation/ resilience in the face of climate change drivers (xenobiotic exposure)?

-   Can we define a tipping- point in mussel's physiology and/ or their role in ecosystem health?

    -   If there is a tipping point, to what degree does prior exposure create phenotypic response?

    -   What are the ecosystem- level consequences of foundational organisms reaching tipping points?

    -   What mechanisms control phenotypic response to prior exposures (aka epigenetic memory)?

-   Do we actually have methylation described in mussels? What resources/ information is out there to support putting that picture together?

### New (to me) Literature

Reviewing *Mytilus trossulus* genome literature, I came across a ton of cool papers that I want to discuss in the context of pollutant work, resilience, and hitting a knowledge gap that isn't a chasm or a dead end. The 3 below are just a few that are interesting to me.

-   \[Paper 1: Breton et al. (2006) Comparative analysis of gender-associated complete mtDNA genomes in marine mussels\] (https://github.com/ChrisMantegna/labnotebook/blob/main/resources/Breton%20et%20al.%20-%202006%20-%20Comparative%20Analysis%20of%20Gender-Associated%20Complete%20Mitochondrial%20Genomes%20in%20Marine%20Mussels%20(%20Myti.pdf)
-   [Paper 2: Breton et al. (2021) Did doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) of mtDNA originate as a cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system?](https://github.com/ChrisMantegna/labnotebook/blob/main/resources/Breton%20et%20al.%20-%202022%20-%20Did%20doubly%20uniparental%20inheritance%20(DUI)%20of%20mtDNA%20originate%20as%20a%20cytoplasmic%20male%20sterility%20(CMS)%20sy.pdf)
-   [Paper 3: Chelyadina et al. (2022) Effects of heavy metals on sex inversion of the mussel *Mytilus galloprovincialis* in coastal zone of the Black Sea](https://github.com/ChrisMantegna/labnotebook/blob/main/resources/Chelyadina%20et%20al.%20-%202022%20-%20Effects%20of%20heavy%20metals%20on%20sex%20inversion%20of%20the%20mussel%20Mytilus%20galloprovincialis%20Lam.%2C%201819%20in%20coast.pdf)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Some questions that are coming up

-   Do we know why the paternal mtDNA is more degraded than the maternal mtDNA and found dominantly in male offspring?
-   Have we seen anything to indicate the population ratios around PS during or after the marine heat waves?
-   Is it ethical (assuming they live long enough) to expose mussels to contaminants (heavy metals maybe) induce spawning and sex change and see if there is a difference in methylation patterns?
