Today's goal is to recap last week's committee meeting and review the scaffolding for re-working the PhD proposal.

### Post- Meeting Notes

Steven and I discussed framing my PhD proposal and have settled on this path to explore. We'll refine as we move forward, and as I learn to read my own handwriting a little better!

The overarching theme is: Exploring xenobiotic effects and consequences in mussels (to mussel physiology)

-   Chapters 1 & 2 (my MS work) remain the biomarker and DNA methylation work, respectively

    -   Can the mussels from the WDFW Nearshore Monitoring Program be used to assess the impact of contaminants on the mussels using traditional biomarkers?

    -   Can epigenetics (DNA Methylation) be used to identify novel biomarkers of PAH exposure in mussels?

-   Chapter 3 is lab testing the results of the Chapter 2

    -   Utilize 'new' mussels to test the outcomes of the mussels that show differential methylation from Chapter 2.

    -   Short- term (1-3 month) and longer term (3-6 month) lab- based exposure and response experiments designed to characterize the metabolic threshold of mussels exposed to known contaminant mixtures that mimic those in Puget Sound.

        -   Clarify stress induced DMLs and their pathways. Do they align with the DMLs in Chapter 2?

-   Chapter 4 is a larger synthesis of the knowledge gained in Chapters 2 and 3.

    -   What are the contaminants inducing in mussels that can have broader population or ecosystem implications?

        -   This can be assessed through a variety of field- based experiments

            -   Outplanting primed and non-primed mussels to assess response at sites with higher or lower contaminant burdens.

            -   Reciprocal outplanting - mussels outplanted at high contaminant sites are moved to sites with low contamination and vice versa.

#### Larger questions we're kicking around to use as guides in creating the initial proposal (in addition to those above)

-   Do epigenetics play a role in creating a phenotypic buffer that supports mussel acclimation/ resilience in the face of climate change drivers (xenobiotic exposure)?

-   Can we define a tipping- point in mussel's physiology and/ or their role in ecosystem health?

    -   If there is a tipping point, to what degree does prior exposure create phenotypic response?

    -   What are the ecosystem- level consequences of foundational organisms reaching tipping points?

    -   What mechanisms control phenotypic response to prior exposures (aka epigenetic memory)?

-   Do we actually have methylation described in mussels? What resources/ information is out there to support putting that picture together?
