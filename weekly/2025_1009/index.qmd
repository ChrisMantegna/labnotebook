------------------------------------------------------------------------

### MS Research Questions

::: callout-Focus
Leveraging existing biomonitoring programs to assess organismal response to legacy contaminants and heavy metals in Puget Sound.
:::

> Main Question: Can long-running mussel outplant data from WDFW's Nearshore Monitoring Program be leveraged to link contaminant exposure to physiological and epigenetic responses in *Mytilus trossulus*?
>
> -   Do established biomarkers in *M. trossulus* show reproducible exposure–response associations with site-level contaminant burdens and classes?
>
> -   Which exposure-associated methylation signatures and pathways in *M. trossulus* could inform the development of candidate molecular biomarkers?

### Current Research

PLACEHOLDER/ REMINDER TEXT: All current research will have the research question below the project name Current status of the project (manuscript prep, data analysis, bench work, etc) A plot or image, and anticipated outcome

#### Biomarkers

::: {callout-Question}
Do established biomarkers in *M. trossulus* show reproducible exposure–response associations with site-level contaminant burdens and classes?
:::

> **Project Status:** Manuscript drafting
>
> **Results Outcome:** The biomarker and morphometric measurements were inconsistent with the contaminant profiles at each site, most likely due to a combination of post-retrieval handling and temporal scale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### DNA Methylation

::: {callout-Question}
Which exposure-associated methylation signatures and pathways in *M. trossulus* could inform the development of candidate molecular biomarkers? 
:::

> **Project Status:** Analysis in progress 
>
> **Project Goals:** Discover exposure-associated methylation signatures and pathway enrichments that prioritize targets for next-generation biomarkers.

### Expansion to PhD

#### Research Questions

::: callout-Focus
Conservation Ecology encompasses diverse expertise, methodologies, and perspectives, yet the integration of these knowledge systems remains a persistent challenge. Centered on the nearshore ecosystems of Puget Sound, my research examines both the ecological responses of foundational species to legacy contaminants and the human systems shaping conservation practice and knowledge exchange. I aim to link biological and socio-cultural data to understand how interdisciplinary frameworks can strengthen conservation outcomes and training.
:::

> Main Question: How can multiple knowledge systems (scientific, community based, and traditional) be more effectively woven together to improve conservation efficacy in nearshore ecosystems?
>
> -   What are the patterns of community composition and species interactions in Puget Sound’s nearshore ecosystems, and how are these shaped by gradients of contamination and habitat condition? (yellow island)
>
> > -   **Purpose:** Connect molecular and physiological indicators (from your MS) to community-level processes — showing that contaminants influence not just individuals but ecological structure and function.
>
> -   How do legacy contaminants and heavy metals influence the physiological and epigenetic resilience of foundational nearshore organisms?
>
> > -   **Purpose:** Extend the MS focus by incorporating methylation and physiological pathways into a broader framework of resilience and adaptive capacity.
>
> -   How can data-driven insights and interdisciplinary frameworks be mobilized to train and empower the next generation of conservation ecologists?
>
> > -   **Purpose:** Create a practical link between your research outputs and conservation capacity-building — connecting ecological monitoring, pedagogy, and community partnership.

### Enough to pivot to a PhD? Thoughts, suggestions, callouts?

add a graphic or something not project relates to allow for time to review without seeing next up or previous work

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Transitioning to PhD

#### Steps

add the truncated checklist here - 12 items with a quick explainer for MS requirements and PhD requirements (maybe make a 2 column checkbox setup - use traffic lights; green is done, yellow is in progress and red isn't started yet)

#### Timeline - make a funnel, big picture down to the next 40 days

Bypass package due to the graduate school November 15th for a Winter Quarter PhD student status Written exam window: Feb 1 - 28 PhD proposal submission: March 15 - April 15 PhD proposal defense: May

#### Asks - add the ask below each major phase (editing/ feedback, signatures on docusign forms, reading list)

#### Deliverables

biomarker manuscript draft - 10/10 MS thesis draft - 10/17 PhD proposal draft 10/24
