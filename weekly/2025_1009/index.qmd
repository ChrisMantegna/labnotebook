### MS Research Questions

::: callout-Focus
Leveraging existing biomonitoring programs to assess organismal response to legacy contaminants and heavy metals in Puget Sound.
:::

> Main Question: Can long-running mussel outplant data from WDFW's Nearshore Monitoring Program be leveraged to link contaminant exposure to physiological and epigenetic responses in *Mytilus trossulus*?
>
> > Do established biomarkers in *M. trossulus* show reproducible exposure–response associations with site-level contaminant burdens and classes?
>
> > Which exposure-associated methylation signatures and pathways in *M. trossulus* could inform the development of candidate molecular biomarkers?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Current Research

#### Biomarkers

::: {callout-Question}
Do established biomarkers in *M. trossulus* show reproducible exposure–response associations with site-level contaminant burdens and classes?
:::

> **Project Status:** Manuscript drafting
>
> **Results Outcome:** The biomarker and morphometric measurements were inconsistent with the contaminant profiles at each site, most likely due to a combination of post-retrieval handling and temporal scale.

#### DNA Methylation - change plot

::: {callout-Question}
Which exposure-associated methylation signatures and pathways in *M. trossulus* could inform the development of candidate molecular biomarkers?
:::

> **Project Status:** Analysis in progress
>
> **Project Goals:** Discover exposure-associated methylation signatures and pathway enrichments that prioritize targets for next-generation biomarkers.

### Expansion to PhD

#### Research Questions

::: {callout-Focus}
Conservation Ecology encompasses diverse expertise, methodologies, and perspectives, yet the integration of these knowledge systems remains a persistent challenge. Centered on the nearshore ecosystems of Puget Sound, my research examines both the ecological responses of foundational species to legacy contaminants and the human systems shaping conservation practice and knowledge exchange. I aim to link biological and socio-cultural data to understand how interdisciplinary frameworks can strengthen conservation outcomes and training.
:::

> Main Question: How can multiple knowledge systems (scientific, community based, and traditional) be more effectively woven together to improve conservation efficacy in nearshore ecosystems?
>
> > What are the patterns of community composition and species interactions in Puget Sound’s nearshore ecosystems, and how are these shaped by gradients of contamination and habitat condition?
>
> > How do legacy contaminants and heavy metals influence the physiological and epigenetic resilience of foundational nearshore organisms?
>
> > How can data-driven insights and interdisciplinary frameworks be mobilized to train and empower the next generation of conservation ecologists?

#### Yellow Island Experiential Learning & eDNA - add image

> **Purpose:** Connect molecular and physiological indicators to community-level processes showing that contaminants influence not just individual organisms but ecological structure and function.
>
> **Project Objectives:** Compare traditional quadrat/ transect data with eDNA from 2023 - 2025 to build intertidal community profile, assess the efficacy of experiential learning in a field setting.
>
> **Project Status:** Data collected, analysis in progress for quadrat/ transect data, and bench work prep for 2024-25 eDNA samples
>
> **Possible Projected Outcomes:** Yellow Island is a difficult to access nature preserve with marine reserve status that influences the boating, fishing and recreation on the island; it is expected that species abundance and diversity is more robust than those on surrounding islands. Additionally, it is expected that the eDNA results will clarify the quadrat/ transect results. Both data sources will support an assessment on the skill, teaching, or knowledge gaps with teaching in this program.

#### Conservation Ecology - pull from g-drive

> **Purpose:** Create a practical link between my research and conservation capacity-building by connecting ecological monitoring, pedagogy, and community partnership.
>
> **Project Objectives:** tying in the human aspect to the organism and ecosystem work
>
> **Project Status:**
>
> **Projected Outcomes:**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Kenya eDNA - pull from g-drive

> Question: What is the community composition of Lake Victoria?
>
> Objective: applying marine techniques to freshwater systems & building collabs across UMN and KNM
>
> Project Status:
>
> Project Outcomes:

### Pitfalls, Potential... Perfection?!?

add a graphic or something not project relates to allow for time to review without seeing next up or previous work
