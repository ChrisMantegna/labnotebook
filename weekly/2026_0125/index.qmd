> > Following the established protocols of the Resazurin Assay [(Huffmyer et al., 2025)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.06.686367v1#:~:text=Abstract,as%20a%20measure%20of%20metabolism.), I modified the assay to support a trial run for *Mytilus trossulus*. This work had two goals:
>
> > First, test the metabolic response of mussels held for 30 days in progressively increased water temperatures.
>
> > Second, assess the efficacy of the standing protocol for my next mussel experiment, particulalry since mussels are less robust than oysters in several ways.

### Established Protocol Adjustments

1.  Most of the mussels were on the larger side of the 'large' classification outlined in the protocol, so I measured using ImageJ as outlined, and measured length, width, and height (in mm) to also proxy volume.
2.  The seawater used for the working solution was at a salinity of 27, aligned with the target for the 30-day experiment. This is an adjustment for record-keeping rather than to the protocol itself.
3.  I purposefully selected mussels as follows:
    1.  The heat treated mussels were similar in size, so one of the control treatment groups were specifically chosen to match size
    2.  One exceptionally large mussel was chosen to see if size had an effect on the assay results
    3.  All mussels used in a 'seawater-only' control for the assay were as identical in size as possible.
4.  I loaded a plate in triplicate for all values based on unclear expectations for the activity. In addition to that, the following changes to the plate load were:
    1.  Two full rows of resazurin-only wells to ensure there was an accurate "blank" or control value to subtract background fluorescence from.
    2.  Two full rows of seawater-only wells to verify fluorescence from the seawater itself was negligible.

### Setup

Before complete take-down of the 30-day survival experiment, mussels were collected (as seen below) and held in their respective tank water before being measured, photographed, and put into their assigned individual containers.

Mussels were measured two ways: first using calipers to measure width, height, and length, and second, was using ImageJ software. Total working solution volume was determined using three ways: using caliper measurements as a proxy for volume (length x width x height) and converted to cm\^3 and summed for total mL; second, using the area measurement tool in ImageJ and converting the same as the first method; and finally, mechanical adding of water to a cup until the mussel was completely submerged, and then measuring that volume using a graduated cylinder. The first and third methods were closely aligned, the second was below required volume.

Mussels were in their treatment solution at room temperature (20C) for approximately 35 minutes before being placed in the cold room for T1 and T2 sampling.
