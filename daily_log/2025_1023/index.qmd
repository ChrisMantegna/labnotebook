- Today was spent working on gathering some baseline data on mytilus trossulus genome, general mytilus species' genomes, and working through some of my knowledge gaps about mussels.
- When meeting with Steven, we talked through my agenda and most recent lit findings, what my next steps should be for building my proposal and a few steps to get started on the methylation dataset.
- I finished the day by applying for the Climate Wayfinders program, which is a fellowship program for early career researchers interested in climate change research, education and science communication.
