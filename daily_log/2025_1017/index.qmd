-   I have spent my science- focused time continuing my work on my PhD proposal and bypass timeline re-work. Looking at the plan Steven and I worked on yesterday, I mapped a few big questions and plans to test them so that we can have a productive 1v1 next week.
-   My next priority was finishing my readings for FISH 510 and outlining my presentation. I got my discussion post up and created a slide catastrophe of ideas that I'll refine over the weekend.
