### January Goals

1.  Finish these proposals and get them out to my committee by the end of the month for a chance at submitting a bypass package by the February deadline.
2.  Get the biomarker manuscript polished enough to go to WDFW for review and sign-off.

### Today's Work

-   Day 9. Mussel Check 1430

-   Visual tank inspections looked good for airflow and water clarity; clear reduction in food since yesterday. Mussels were still aggregated in their respective bags/ coolers. The airflow in blue remains a bit lower than in red. Will continue to monitor.
