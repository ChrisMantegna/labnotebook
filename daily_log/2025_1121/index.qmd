- I started the day by trying to streamline the lab- based experiment that should be conducted in the winter. It is a bit larger and more involved right now than I think it needs to be.
- I moved next to updating my daily lab notebook entries for the week, I didn't realize I was this far behind.
- My next task is to work on finishing my MS proposal and get it to Steven for editing before passing off to my committee. I need to have it uploaded and confirmed by my committee by 12/12/25 and this is far tighter a window than I anticipated providing for edits and feedback.
