In true to me fashion, a new academic year means a new notebook setup that will hopefully make it a bit easier for me to update my work daily. Today's science focus was on rebuilding, updating and launching my 2025-26 AY lab notebook. Related, I made a 'sprint' task list for quick tasks I can do to tighten up my GitHub setup, cleanup my repos, and identify any pinch points for making a daily update.
My second focus was to setup weekly meetings with my PI and gather materials for my first meeting on 9.25.25.
