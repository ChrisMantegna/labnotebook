- Today's work was limited to task completion. Tuesday's are fully RUA days so science is limited anyway, but it was more limited today because I had a previously scheduled obligation that wiped out any deep thinking/ deep work time.
- I attended fish 510 and confirmed I will be giving the week 4 presentation on my epigenetic topic of interest.
- I continued work on my bypass presentation, just shifted it over to quarto so that it is a notebook post.
