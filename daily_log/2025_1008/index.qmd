- The name of the game is get that damn presentation together, out and reviewed by Steven before tomorrow. The bulk of my time has been spent on that.
- I met with Logan today to discuss how to set up interviews for grad schools and some timeline planning for when/ how she is knocking out the major written portions for applications and grant applications.
- I worked with KPJ today on re-familiarizing myself with the biomarker manuscript graveyard - should make it easier for me to jump back in to the work tomorrow when time is less of a constriction.
