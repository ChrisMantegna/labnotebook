- Today's only goal was to make it through my committee meeting and come through the other side with a plan. It didn't go as expected, but I do have a plan. After the meeting, I re-confirmed with Sam that I did in fact have one quarter of funding remaining - I do, and then I continued on with my non-science responsibilities to wrap up the day.
