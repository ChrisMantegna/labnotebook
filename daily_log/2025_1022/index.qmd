- Much reading and writing today focused on getting through the papers I gathered over the weekend. Interestingly, I just learned that mussels inherit mtDNA from maternal and paternal lines...
  - I also put my agenda together for my 1v1 with Steven tomorrow. This is the earliest I've done it and so close to the 24hr mark that maybe I will make it next week!
