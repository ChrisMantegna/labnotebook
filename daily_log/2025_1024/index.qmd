- I spent some time cleaning up the mussel methylation repo and taking a few steps to understand the bioinformatics workflow, programs and expected outcomes
- I read three of the four papers for next week's FISH class.
- I built my analysis progress notes in my methylation in Notion, noted what needs to be expanded or further explained, linked my literature from Zotero, and built the script for the initial data pull, reference pull, and multiQC steps.
