- I returned to the FISH 510 coursework first today. I completed my notes for the Week 2 papers, answered the discussion questions and got my posts and responses to others up on the discussion board.
- I finished the day by brain dumping my thoughts from my biomarker lit reconciliation. I moved pieces into their respective manuscript sections, aligned any citations that related, and tried to pull out the important pieces that keep the doc moving forward without my desire to wax poetic about the whole thing.
