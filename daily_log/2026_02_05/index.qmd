Oh, that's right, he said "Life is what happens to you while you're busy
making other plans." Well, life today definitely didn't agree with my
plans.

### Projects Touched Today

-   mussel biomarkers

### New Knowledge

-   So, in my quest to wrap up mapping, I found a mistake in my spatial
    analysis of the biomarker metrics and indices. When I mapped my
    spatial results, I started with the geographic clusters designated
    using K-Means clustering that I verified with variance and
    significance testing ensure the groups were statisically different
    enough to be meaningful. When I threw the groups in the map, it
    looked like I just threw out a handful of fruit loops and said
    'ok'...
    -   First, I went back and double checked the sites and assigned
        color palette were correct. Next I went to the data table to
        verify the values were in the correct format and not mistakenly
        overwritten. Finally, I moved over to check the code I used to
        analyze the clusters.
    -   One seven letter word got me- degrees. I completed the SPATIAL
        analysis in degrees, not distance. I made a note in the R code,
        and moved back over to GIS to redo the analysis.
-   To redo the analysis, I did the following:
    -   Imported a clean table of the metrics and identifiers, and
        formatted the columns from characters to actual numbers for next
        steps
    -   Next we need to link the table to the map, so I created a point
        layer to link the Puget Sound map. This takes the lat/ long data
        and converts it from coordinates (degrees) to actual distances.
        I confirmed the projection and moved to confirm the results.
    -   To verify that worked, beyond the points showing up on the map,
        I ran a distance matrix summary (by site_id, k=5) to verify the
        point layer and to guide the parameters I select in the Moran's
        I analysis. The summary gives you a quick table of minimum and
        mean distances and the standard deviation; these guide the
        distance bands (scale) for Moran's.
    -   I confirmed the distance matrix by running a linear matrix that
        shows if the distances are actually varying, there aren't any
        self-comparisons, and verify both tests returned consistent
        results.
    -   Happy with the confirmation, I ran the Moran's I (spatial
        autocorrelation- regional or global) for p450, mapped the
        result, and then moved to sod.
        -   P450 showed a few significant clusters, SOD did not. This
            aligns with the KW comparisons and the Spearman's
            correlations results. Thank goodness.
-   Tomorrow, I will return to the Moran's I analysis of the remaining
    metrics (18 of 20 total), the LISA analysis (all 20), and begin
    mapping the results one metric at a time.

### Old Tricks

The log of mapping decisions I may need to return to:

-   Returned to the sampling site map, added insets for Seattle and
    Tacoma, and threw it in canva to clean up the format.

-   I chose to add the following city labels:

    -   Olympia, Tacoma, Seattle, Everett, Penn Cove, and San Juan
        Islands

-   The insets have the city label only for Tacoma and both the city
    label and Bainbridge Island for the Seattle one because of the
    geography captured in the inset

-   Next maps will most likely not need the Canva step since I figured
    out how to do adjust borders independently in QGIS, but we’ll see.

    -   I created a specific color palette for reporting areas in QGIS
        to be used in all plotting/ mapping for consistency. Hex codes
        follow a pound sign with no spaces, and are as follows:

        -   6 - 0f6f6c (dark teal)

        -   7 - 6a4c93 (plum)

        -   8.1 - c7352d (brick red)

        -   8.2 - d4a437 (gold)

        -   9 - e07a5f (coral/ salmon)

        -   10 - 4fb3a2 (light teal)

        -   11 - ff7f00 (orange)

        -   12 - 33a02c (yellow)

        -   13 - 1f3c5b (navy blue)

    -   My sampling site basemap is in purple with black borders

        -   Seattle inset is framed in black

        -   Tacoma inset is framed in white - may need to change to
            yellow or something brighter

    -   My sites by reporting area map is just like the sites map,
        except color coded as outlined above.

        -   The legend is framed in the same weight as the other frames,
            and has no background so that it doesn’t stand out so
            starkly.

        -   This map feels VERY busy, feedback will help for refining

### Questions or Concerns?

-   I made a quick protocol for converting non-geometric data into
    geometric data in QGIS. Mainly to help myself not miss a step, but
    secondarily to make sure I am creating mapping layers in the right
    projections with the right formats before I start mapping, rather
    than get stuck in the middle because nothing is working correctly.

-   This and the maps will be in my weekly wrap-up.

### Tomorrow's Plan

-   Tomorrow (2/6), I will return to the Moran's I analysis of the
    remaining metrics (18 of 20 total), the LISA analysis (all 20), and
    begin mapping the results one metric at a time.
-   The documentation and analysis of the mussel pilot experiment and
    resazurin trials will get put back in the queue behind finishing the
    biomarker work.
