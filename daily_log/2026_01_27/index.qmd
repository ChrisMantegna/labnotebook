### Projects Touched Today
No project work today. Tuesdays are UW-RUA days.

### New Knowledge
I held an event to explain what UW-RUA can do, what the postdocs and PhD-C's need to apply, and generally trying to facilitate conversations and getting to know each other beyond just asking about the program. I learned far more about engineering than I expected, but enjoyed the clarity into how different graduate programs work.

### Old Tricks
Data cleaning and analysis for the historic UW-RUA program (all three iterations) has been a nice way to keep my exploratory visualization skills up. 

### Questions or Concerns?
No.

### Tomorrow's Plan
Fly home.
