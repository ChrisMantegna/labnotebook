- I started off the day reviewing the papers I pulled last night for my PhD proposal. I did quick searches on Web of Science and Google Scholar for epigenetic work done in the ecotoxicology discipline, and while the results were limited, there was a ton of opinions in how epigenetics can be used as a tool to support understanding of the impact of legacy contaminants in foundational model organisms.\

 - I am part of the team of submitters for the PromethION proposal. Today I helped with the final reading/ editing and it looks great. Mike has knocked it out of the park and I hope this comes to fruition.
