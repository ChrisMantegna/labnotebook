- I started the day by consolidating all of my noted for the week re: my daily notebook posts and dropping them into the actual digital lab notebook.
- Next I moved into writing for the biomarker manuscript. I started with citing the sources for my methods and then worked on the introduction. My results section is still a bullet-point list, but won't be tomorrow when I can sort how to get the results chopped down into a shorter section.
