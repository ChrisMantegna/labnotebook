### Projects Touched Today

### New Knowledge

Day 13. Mussel Check at 1049

Visual tank inspections looked good for airflow and water clarity. Mussels were still aggregated in their respective bags/ coolers. The air stone swap seems to be ok. Will continue to monitor.

-   Temperature

    -   Blue= 11° C

    -   Red= 15° C

-   Salinity

    -   Blue= 27 psu

    -   Red= 26 psu

-   Mortality

    -   Blue= 0

    -   Red= 0

### Old Tricks

-   Not a lot of science beyond the mussel check. Prepping for a RUA day tomorrow.

### Questions or Concerns?

-   None.

### Tomorrow's Plan

-   Tuesdays are RUA days again this quarter, so only mussel checks.
