- Started today's work by checking on the status of my QC work I left running last night. It is still running and I anticipate the trimming and QC will take equally as long, so I will use the Bismark output from my local single sample run to touchbase with Steven in our 1v1 tomorrow.
- While I keep checking in on these things, I am wrapping the introduction for my MS thesis proposal.
