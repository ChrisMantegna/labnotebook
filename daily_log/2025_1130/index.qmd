- I cannot find my annotated bibliography, so I had to comb back through all of my sources to match with what I wrote based on the first- pass notes in Zotero... 0/10 do not recommend.
- I built in the annotated bib section into my Notion literature review database so that as I'm redoing the work, I won't lose it again.
