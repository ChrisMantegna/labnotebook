### Projects Touched Today

-   Mytilus pilot experiment

### New Knowledge

Day 10. Mussel Check at 0600

Visual tank inspections looked good for airflow and water clarity; continued reduction in food since yesterday. Mussels were still aggregated in their respective bags/ coolers. The airflow in blue remains a bit lower than in red. Will continue to monitor.

-   Temperature

    -   Blue= 11° C

    -   Red= 15° C

-   Salinity

    -   Blue= 26 psu

    -   Red= 25 psu

-   Mortality

    -   Blue= 0

    -   Red= 1

### Old Tricks

-   I will not be checking on the mussels on 1/3 since I'm leaving for the coast after this morning's check. I will check upon return on 1/4.

### Questions or Concerns?

-   None

### Tomorrow's Plan

-   Photograph the tides off of La Push and tidepool!
