- I realized today that my MS proposal format is wrong. I am actually doing more than needed. During a writing block with KPJ, we realized I was framing the chapters individually rather than weaving together the common goal of both. This means I have been writing too much detail for each chapter rather than focusing on the overall narrative. I need to reframe my proposal to highlight the connections between chapters and how they contribute to my research question. This is relieving.
