### Projects Touched Today

-   Mussel pilot experiment

### New Knowledge

Day 14. Mussel Check at 1700

Visual tank inspections looked good for airflow and water clarity. Mussels were still aggregated in their respective bags/ coolers. The air stone swap is ok. Will continue to monitor.

-   Temperature

    -   Blue= 11° C

    -   Red= Increasing from 15° C to 18° C

-   Salinity

    -   Blue= 28 psu

    -   Red= 26 psu

-   Mortality

    -   Blue= 2

    -   Red= 0

-   Partial water changes in both coolers. Salinity recheck

    -   Blue= 25 psu

    -   Red= 25 psu

### Old Tricks

-   Tuesday is a RUA workday.

### Questions or Concerns?

-   None

### Tomorrow's Plan

-   Continue to knockdown the lit notes for biomarkers and my proposals.
