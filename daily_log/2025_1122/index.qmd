- I jumped back into Raven to get my alignments going again- my connection timed out two days ago and I have finally finished cleaning out the pieces of files, fixing my script to find the executable version of Bowtie and set it off and running.
- I outlined my blog post for FISH 510, drafted my reflection statement and set up the plan for the presentation for class on 12/2.
