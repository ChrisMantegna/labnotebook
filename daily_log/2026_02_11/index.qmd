### Tomorrow's Plan

- Tomorrow is pretty meeting heavy. I have 2 UW-RUA debrief meetings post traveler return, the NW CASC Info-session, the first of 3 ESA *Future-Proofing Your Science Career* sessions, and a meeting with a former mentee to work through the stats and visualizations for his capstone project featuring the data we collected on Yellow Island from 2023 - 24.

- Specific steps in my own work will be determined post today's meetings.
