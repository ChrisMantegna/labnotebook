### Plan of the Day

-   While the OG plan of the day was to watch the Seahawks redeem the worst decision in football... I really wanted to complete the draft maps of the significantly spatially autocorrelated contaminant classes so I could start fresh on some of the other tasks for the week on Monday.

### Projects Touched Today

-   Mussel Biomarkers

### Progress Notes

-   Started off today reviewing what I knocked out yesterday, and picked back up on mapping the contaminant indices.

    -   Splitting the significant indices into percentiles and detected/ not detected, that makes my layout simpler - I am going to put a grid together for the percentile maps; one shared legend. The top row will be (L-R) pah, pcb, pbde; the bottom row will be (L-R) ddt, total contaminants, legend.

    -   Set my print layout to ANSI B - Landscape; 431.8mm x 279.4mm to make sure I can get 3 across without crowding.

    -   The maps have the same exact setup, only the data varies, so this feels like it should be a clean way to compare the information.

    -   Can’t forget to add the map attribution: Basemap: Esri World Ocean \| © Esri, and the projection: base- EPSG: 3857, points- EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 - Geographic

-   **NOTE:** When I return to the sampling site and P450 maps- they need to match the extent, scale, and labeling of these maps.

    -   Fix the city/ location labels

    -   Everett is misspelled

    -   Olympia may be misplaced

    -   Add Port Angeles or Port Townsend, lots of sites= label

    -   Consider adding waterway labels, like Commencement Bay, Elliott Bay, greater Salish Sea and/ or Puget Sound

-   Back to the contaminant maps

    -   There is an asterisk indicating the reference site - orange and just slightly larger than the map points; don’t forget to add this in the caption

    -   This is a bit dramatic on the page - adjust when refining the maps

-   I am so excited to have finally gotten much closer to aligning the figures with the story in the manuscript draft - since the whole thing is on the shorter side, the figures really have to deliver. There is definite room for improvement; small cleanups on things like aligning frames, text styles, naming convention (I don't think I should pluralize the contaminant abbreviations), and larger refinements for clarity and overall message delivery will be tackled after committee feedback.

### Products & Word Count

### Tomorrow's Plan

-   Reminder to committee to review my MS proposal so I can get it submitted

    -   MS proposal must be submitted and signed off NLT 2/20/26

    -   Schedule a meeting for end of February, early March to discuss PhD proposal and manuscript (full committee will receive NLT MS feedback/ submission is completed)

-   Spend some time reviewing the status of my current projects

    -   I have spent so much time in the QGIS rabbit hole that I need to refresh myself on where everything else stands

    -   Map plan for the week based on that review (including blocks for non-dissertation projects that have also lagged)

    -   Put up outline of 1v1 agenda/ statuses to be completed in advance of my meeting with Steven on 2/11
