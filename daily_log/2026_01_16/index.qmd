### Projects Touched Today

-   mussel pilot experiment
-   PhD proposal

### New Knowledge

Day 24. Mussel Check at 1121

Visual tank inspections looked good for airflow and water clarity. Mussels were still aggregated in their respective bags/ coolers.

-   Temperature

    -   Blue= 11° C

    -   Red= 20° C

-   Salinity

    -   Blue= 26 psu

    -   Red= 26 psu

-   Mortality

    -   Blue= 0

    -   Red= 0

### Old Tricks

-   Returned to the PhD proposal after working on mussel experiment design. Made good progress on writing the methods sections, objectives and research questions. I feel like I matched the tone of the rest of the proposal and the MS proposal. I continued with creating a shortened version for chapters 1 and 2, and read two papers that I previously only read the abstract for.

### Word Count (Productivity)

-   PhD Proposal: 1105 words
-   **Today's total: 1105 words**
-   **Monthly total to date: 4577 words**

### Questions or Concerns?

-   None.

### Tomorrow's Plan

-   Same as yesterday. Continue writing proposals to get them to the committee sooner rather than later. It's getting too close to offer a fair window of return.
