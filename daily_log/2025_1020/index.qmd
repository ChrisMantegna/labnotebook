- Today's work was dominantly task- centered instead of deeper work.
  - I worked on my presentation for FISH 510
  - I attended lab meeting where I met 2 of my 4 goals completely and the remaining 2 at approximately 60% each. My goals for the next meeting are to complete the written pieces from my last goal round, and gain clarity in the DNA Methylation analysis so I can plan my next steps
