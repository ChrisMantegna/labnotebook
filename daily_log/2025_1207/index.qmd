- I spent a good chunk of time reading through the applicable chapters of Applied Environmental Genomics thinking about methods and techniques that are transferable to ecotox work.
- The remainder of the time was spent reading and annotating the 2022 updated text on Marine Mussels from Gosling. I want to be crystal clear on mussel physiology and ecology before I start executing the full experiment.
