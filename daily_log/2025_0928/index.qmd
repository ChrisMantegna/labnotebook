-   All of today's focus was in tidying up my notes and citations for the biomarker manuscript draft. I have left notes or comments for myself that are a little cryptic, or worse, tags that aren't as descriptive as I need. The goal was to ensure I have the right citations in the right places and identify anything that needs additional depth in citations (biomarker work is rich in practitioners) or needs a citation period. This took much longer than I anticipated, so I knocked off for the day after that.
