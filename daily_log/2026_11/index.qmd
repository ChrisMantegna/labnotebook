### Projects Touched Today

-   Mussel pilot experiment

### New Knowledge

Day 19. Mussel Check at 1429

Visual tank inspections looked good for airflow and water clarity. Mussels were still aggregated in their respective bags/ coolers. There remains a smell to the tanks, but that has to be waste products since there are no mortalities.

-   Temperature

    -   Blue= 11° C

    -   Red= 18° C

-   Salinity

    -   Blue= 25 psu

    -   Red= 27 psu

-   Mortality

    -   Blue= 1

    -   Red= 0

### Old Tricks

-   None

### Questions or Concerns?

-   None

### Tomorrow's Plan

-   Map the week ahead to include the following: continue work on the proposals and supplementary visuals for the biomarkers, finalize a draft experimental design to inform the PhD proposal.
