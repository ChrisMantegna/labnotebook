- Today was another heavy task management day versus a deep work day. I started by knocking out my readings and posts for FISH 510 next week. I pivoted to writing time for the biomarker manuscript, and then wrapped up the day by re-framing my bypass package proposals so that I could make a plan to get the work done as quickly as possible.
